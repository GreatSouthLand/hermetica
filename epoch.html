In the “Myth of Er,” which concludes the Republic, Plato outlines the process by which the discarnate soul is paired with its Daimon who guides its descent through the planetary spheres, as it takes on the planetary qualities corresponding to each sphere (such as the vices and virtues) and, finally, is coupled with a body at the pre-natal syzygy (the new or full moon immediately preceding birth) and is, finally, incarnated in the elemental/terrestrial sphere of Earth.<br>
<br>
This descending sequence alludes to an inverse operation – one in which the soul of the initiate ascends, with the help of its Daimon (Guardian Angel, Oikodespotes, Higher Genius, Tutelary Spirit, etc.) and aided by theurgical rites, through the cosmic spheres and re-integrates with the One, attaining the state of henosis/gnosis/theosis, depending on the tradition in question.<br>

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and just like many others, I am a descendant of Australian immigrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of Queensland and New South Wales in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
<br><br>
One and a half centuries later, the collectable information available to recreate
a realistic picture of these people is not altogether detailed or consistent. Yet there are
still many traces remaining that we have managed to gather together here.
<br><br>
<strong>A family history</strong> such as this is obviously full of impressions and opinions
laced together with as much historical information as is available but telling the complete story or stories still remains to be seen. Very often only scant real information is available. <br>
We are very grateful to those people who have already put in a lot of effort, especially for
making records, articles and memorials available and to anyone interested in reading this <strong>so here's a hearty thanks!</strong>
<br><br>
Comments and contributions are always welcome.
