<h1 class="title" > Interpreting Charts with Vettius Valens</h1>


Since this entire website is about Hermetic Astrology, it is best to rely upon an ancient authority who worked exclusively in this arena and who has stood the test of time over an extreme number of centuries. Vettis Valens is one such astrologer who knows best how to interpret a chart within this context and luckily his writings are still available to us. 
<br><br>

<b>Vettius Valens</b> (08.02.120-07.184 CE) was a Greco-Roman Hellenistic astrologer who authored the <i>"Anthologies" (ἀνθολογίαι)</i>, a textbook style set of astrological instructions written in the second century CE, nine volumes of which have survived. <!--Rumours have it that there could have been ten or twelve altogether.--> The content is unusual, not only because Valens was a practicing Hermetic astrologer who describes his methods in great detail, but also because he provides at least 125 horoscopes pertaining to the ancient world. The descriptions have proved to be astronomically accurate and informative, both astrologically and historically. In fact they represent almost the entirety of ancient horoscopes remaining from that era. Outside those, only five others are to be found before the year 380 CE. He also includes a chart which is very likely his own.
<br><br>

According to some of his biographers, Vettius Valens was a native of Antioch in ancient Syria, which is now known as Antakya in Turkey. After much travelling in search of knowledge, which he claimed was unreliable, he is said to have later moved to Egypt. It has been claimed that he settled in the city of Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great, which was the famed center of learning and commercially more advantageous for his astrology. This is supposedly where he eventually wrote The Anthologies as a text book for his students.
<br><br>

The Anthologies were written sometime between the years 150 and 175 CE and were in use for at least thirteen centuries throughout the dark and middle ages up to the renaissance. Unlike the <i>Tetrabiblos (also known as Apotelesmatika)</i> from Claudius Ptolomy, which also was in use for as many centuries, the Anthologies were from the point of view, and experience of an actively professional astrologer, whereas Ptolomy, who was simply a compiler of the theories of the time, was neither an astrologer nor particularly familiar with the subject in a practical manner.
<br><br>

It has often been mentioned that the techniques used by Valens differed significantly from that of his contemporary, Ptolomy. This is easily explained by the fact that Valens was a Hermetic astrologer and his knowledge was based on a different set of theories and techniques. By carefully studying the Anthologies, much is revealed as to what those unique methods were. Because this was the subject of much study for so long, it is not too surprising that a lot of this material has entered into mainstream astrology still being practised today. Some have taken the Hermetic nature of his work to be of Stoic origin, overlooking how much Stoicism was influenced by Hermeticism.
<br><br>

Especially when it comes to Valens, the Hermetic peculiarities in his astrology, are still puzzling philologists, historians and astrologers who are unable to borrow from preconceived ideas with the intention of 'correcting' any errors they 'discover' in his old texts, justifying their method through claims that the texts have experienced transcription errors over time. Thus, many ancient texts have been modified so extensively that their importance has suffered. Luckily, the Anthologies, at least since the Byzantine (395–1453 CE), seems to have been spared much of this fate.


<hr class="blank h30">



Vettius Valens said at the beginning of the Anthologies Book 6:
<br>
<div class="quo grey">
"I have written this because I have prided myself on the knowledge bestowed on me from heaven by the Divinity, knowledge which is now dishonored and rejected, even though it is primordial and governs everything in life, and even though without it there neither is nor will be anything. Now even its name seems to be hated, although men before our times prayed for it and blessed themselves by it. I am grieved by this, and I envy the old kings and rulers who devoted themselves to such matters. I am envious because I was not fortunate enough to live in those times which saw such a climate of free and ungrudging speech and inquiry. Their devotion to this science was so enthusiastic and so steadfast that they left the earthly sphere and walked the heavens, associating with the heavenly souls and the divine, holy Minds. Of this Nechepso is a witness when he says: I seemed to walk the midnight aether, and a voice from heaven echoed around me, at which the dark robe covered my flesh, bringing the gloom of night… and so on. Who would not consider this knowledge to be superior to any other and to be blessed, since by means of it one can know the sun’s ordered paths which foretell the changing seasons when it enters the tropics in the advances and retardations of its motion; one can know the risings and settings, the days and nights, the seasons’ cold or heat, and the weather? It is also possible to know the varying paths of the moon, its inclinations and departures, its waxing and waning, its heights and its depths, the direction of its winds, its contacts and separations, its eclipses, its near eclipses, and all the rest. From all this it seems possible to understand everything on earth, in the seas, in heaven, as well as the beginning and end of all events. Likewise for the five other stars, with their motions, their uneven paths, and their varied phases."

<h4>
<b>Sources</b>

<h6>The Sources of Vettius Valens</h6> 

Valens said that his astronomical material was mainly sourced from the astronomers Hipparchus and Apollonius.  His data for the sun and moon were from the Babylonians, Kidenas and Soudines. He mentioned that he studied the "ancient astrologers", namely the legendary Egyptian astrologers, "King" Nechepso and the Sage Petosiris as well as Critodemus, an astrologer from the first century. 
<br>


<h6>The Sources of the Translators</h6> 

The texts which were used for modern translations of Vettius Valens, came from two sources, both in Greek with Latin prefaces and footnotes. The earlier one was from Wilhelm Kroll, dated 1908. The other was from David Pingree, and published in 1986. These in turn originate from a Byzantine fifth century manuscript. 
<br><br>

The first English translations of The Anthologies were made by Robert Schmidt and ran between 1993 to 2001 in a series from Robert Hand's Golden Hind Press. The earliest translation into German appeared in 2004 under the title of <i>Blütensträusse</i> by Otto Schönberger and Eberhard Knobloch. Finally, the most recent translation into English was by Professor Mark Riley who made it available on the internet in 2010 and is now in book form published by Chris Brennan.
<br><br>

In 1959, the mathematician, Otto Neugebauer (1899-1990), together with the scholar and librarian, Henry Bartlett van Hoesen (1885-1965), published <i>Greek Horoscopes</i>, which was a collection of literary data found in ancient manuscripts. They were the first to mention the importance of the writings of Vettius Valens as supplying reliable information regarding the astronomical methods employed by an astrologer of the ancient world. Even though the dates were not specifically mentioned, the two researchers managed to verify his astronomical data by what Valens had mentioned in his astrology.
<br><br>

Nevertheless, despite their good intentions and rigorous scholastic approach, on page 10 of <i>Greek Horoscopes</i> is an example of the type of confident false assumption, backed up by unrelated fact, written about the word <i>"phase" (φάσή)</i> supposedly as it was used in <i>The Anthologies</i>:<br>

<div class="quo vdgreen">

The concept of "phase" is <u>probably</u> derived from the observation of bright fixed stars. In the Greek calendars the characteristic risings and settings of stars are listed in their relation to the seasons. These first or last appearances in the morning or evening are called the "phases."

</div>

as well as on pages 27 and 28:
<br>

<div class="quo vdgreen">
"Phase." This term is used here in a much looser sense than ordinarily (cf., Introduction p. 10). Mercury at superior conjunction is said to have completed its phase." <u>This can only mean</u> that its "phase" as morning star is ended.
</div>

<br>
Both of these are incorrect and the meaning of the word "phase"  (φάσή) fits better the meaning used on the page <a href="cycles.htm">&raquo; Cycles and Phases</a>.

<b>Hero of the Day</b>
<br>
<span>
The Names of the Days of the Week
</span>
</h4>
<br>

There is evidence (from the research of Ilaria Bultrighini and Sacha Stern) that the very first mention of a seven day week was made in the City of Rome during the first century of the Common Era (CE). It remained isolated within the city for some time, making little impact on the outside world. This contradicts the current idea that the seven day week was invented by Babylonian, Egyptian or Hellenistic astronomers, for which there is apparently no evidence whatsoever.
<br><br>

Vettius Valens, in the Greco-Roman world at the eastern edge of the Mediterranean, was the first person to explain the origin of the names of the seven week-days. Unlike how is now claimed about the weekdays gaining their names from a seven pointed star crossing from one side to another, which does indeed work, the names of the days were actually derived by another means.
<br><br>

That a month has four weeks, each of seven days, is related to the cycle of the moon, from which the word "month" is derived. These four weeks are related to the four main lunar phases in the cycle of the moon, namely new moon, first quarter, full moon and last quarter. These are fundamental to lunar calendars to keep track of time.
<br><br>

Since each day has twenty-four hours, a week has altogether 168 hours (7 x 24). These hours have been astrologically assigned planetary rulers in what is known as the Chaldean Order, regarding distances from the earth and times taken to travel through the Zodiac, in order of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. 
<br><br>

Each day in the Roman Empire, at the time, started at sunrise and the first day of the week was given Saturn as its ruler, the first of the planets in order. Each hour that followed after, was given as its ruler, the next planet in order. Therefore the second hour after sunrise on the first day of the week had Jupiter as its ruler, and so on through all the planets and then repeating the sequence.
<br><br>

At the beginning of the second day, the ruler was the Sun, and so that day became the Sun day. The beginning of the third day was ruled by the Moon and became the Moon day, and so on through the seven days.
<br><br>




<hr class="leaf">




<h4>
<b>Time Lords</b>
<br>
<span>
The Chronocrators
</span>
</h4>
<br>


Vettius Valens was also the first person to systematically use the <i>Time Lords (Greek: chronokratores, χρονοκράτορες)</i>, the rulers of cyclical and sequential periods which occur throughout human life and whose calculation covers the span of life. 
<br><br>

After becoming somewhat disillusioned by false teachers, Vettius Valens decided to take a break from astrology. His curiosity eventually overcame him once more and he returned to it years later with even more enthusiasm than before over the topic of <i>chronocrators, the time lords</i>. This time he presented everything he could discover on the subject and even developed his own methods to determine how planetary rulerships affect people's lives.
<br><br>

The <i>Time Lords</i> were used in Egyptian astrology before the time of Valens but their origin, and the logic behind them, has since been lost. A number of different methods have been used to discover the ruler of a particular part of life, and more recently have (supposedly) become a modern technique known as (yearly) <i>profections</i>. What he does mention is that someone named Abraham was an authority on the distribution of operative <i>chronocratorship</i> in relation to the <i>Lot of Daimon</i>. 

Even though Valens talks extensively about <i>Time Lords</i>, starting at Book I 21, he doesn't actually introduce the subject before using the term, as if it didn't require introduction. Some have noted that this could be because it was such common practice at the time that it this would have been unnecessary. 
<br><br>

At Anthologies IV 14, there is the first mention of the lengths of rulerships with Saturn as 30 years, Jupiter 12, Mars 15, Sun 19, Venus 8, Mercury 20 and Moon 25. At this point Valens mentions that someone he calls "The King", who is probably the legendary "King Nechepso", introduced in his 13th book, the Lot of Fortune as being the "Ruling Place", a point from which the length of life may be determined.
<br><br>

Book IV of Anthologies starts under the title of <i>The Distributions of Periods</i>. Here Valens has taken the rulerships according to years and converted them for so many months as they previously were for years. In this way, the <i>Time Lords</i>, according to the 10-year 9-month system as it is called in Book III 9, are assigned to 129 month periods divided between the planets in order.
<br><br>

He said:

<div class="quo vdgreen">
<i>
We believe that we have set forth an appropriate, in fact, magisterial, explanation of the previous [theorems].
We will now reveal a topic investigated by many and hidden from view, namely the distribution of propitious
and impropitious times. We must preface our discussion with the distributions which have been proven by our
own experience. The primary period is one-fourth of the minimum period, as follows:
</i>

<br>

<br>

Therefore, the first 30 months of life has Saturn as the <i>Time Lord</i>. The next 12 months has Jupiter as its <i>Time Lord</i>, and so on up to the end of the first 129 months by which time all of the first set of periods have occurred and then the cycle repeats. Each of these cycles is 129 months, or 10 years and 9 months, in length.

<b>Three Score Years and Ten</b>
<br>
The expression <i>Three Score Years and Ten</i> is derived from one of the methods for determining <i>Time Lords</i>. By this system, known from Shakespeare as the "Seven Ages of Man", human life is allocated seven periods according to the seven planets in order, and totalling 70 years altogether:

<!--The Egyptian Time Keepers<br-->
and Their Chronocrators

</h4>
<br>

According to what Vettius Valens teaches about the Egyptian Terms, each sign of the zodiac is divided into five sections of varying amounts, making <i>60 Terms</i> altogether. The table to the right shows where those <i>Terms</i> are and the effects on a planet or other object when it falls into one of them. 
<br><br>

Using the chart which is claimed to be for Vettius Valens himself (also shown to the right), these are the meanings of his planetary positions:
<br><br>

<br><br>
Mars in Virgo 22°41'
<br><br>
Jupiter in Libra 23°12'
<br><br>
Saturn in Gemini 29°14' <br>
= Term of Saturn:<br>

Curtis Manwaring said:<br>
<div class="quo vdgreen">
<i>
The ancient position was that a planet does not "transit" unless it is a chronocrator for the times for the issue being sought; in other words, it must be a time lord so that the planets testimony about the natives life can be heard. This would explain the times that a transit appears to be mute, i.e., does not manifest in any obvious way.

<h4>
<b>Language and Gender</b>
</h4>
<br>


The words "feminine" and "masculine" are very often used in astrology and Vettius Valens uses them a lot to denote specific qualities and tendencies. Although always done for convenience, they should never be understood to mean the same as when biologically referring to humans. The idea of intermingling these ideas should also be avoided. To help with understanding these symbols, it is perhaps advisable to adopt an attitude that they are specialist terms with specialist meanings.
<br><br>

Anthologies Book I 12. Masculine and Feminine Degrees:
<br>
<div class="quo vdgreen">
The masculine and feminine degrees are as follows: the first 2&frac12; degrees of the masculine signs are masculine, the next 2&frac12; degrees are feminine. The first 2&frac12; degrees of feminine signs are feminine, the next 2&frac12; degrees are masculine, the next 2&frac12; are feminine.
</div>
<br>




The concept of "feminine", in astrology, is also referred to as "negative", another problematic word when taken to mean the same as in common use. The actual meaning within astrology is that of being receptive, perceptive, open, creative, considerate, sensitive, and so forth. If anything, the popular human female stereotype could gain from acquiring more of the astrological symbolism. Lastly, "feminine" is more akin to the concept of "yin" in eastern philosophy, and it is there, that a lot more insight may be gained.
<br><br>

The concepts of "negative" and "positive" are more closely related to the terms as used in the physics of electricity, describing the direction of a current, or perhaps in the eastern philosophy of "yin and yang", than they are as to what they mean in psychology with its judgemental overloading.
<br><br>

The concept of "masculine" in astrology is also referred to as "positive". This can be confusing when not understood within its astrological context. Astrologically, "masculine" actually means outgoing, demonstrative, confident, focused, willing, studious, insightful and so forth. Once again, the male stereotype could likely benefit from absorbing more of the astrological symbolism, rather than relying so much, on the claims of psychology. The eastern concept of "yang" can also yield some greater insights.
<br><br>

Finally, in astrology, nothing is only "feminine" or "masculine", for they are tendencies. There is always a mix of their characteristics. Sometimes an astrologer might describe someone, or something, as more feminine, or more masculine but this only refers to the summation of all the elements, themes and chords under consideration, mainly to assist in portraying an overall impression.
<br><br>


<b>Two Examples</b>
<br><br>

1. The Sign of Taurus, the Bull, is female. <br>
It is the astrological gender of the Sign which is female, and not Taurus or the Bull. When an astrologer refers to Taurus as female, it is understood that it is the "Sign of Taurus" being addressed.<br>
<br>
The animal known as the Bull, is male. <br>
It is the biological gender of the animal which is male. When people speak of a bull, it is understood to mean some male animal. <br>
<br><br>

2. The Symbol of the Moon is female. <br>
It is the astrological gender of the symbol which is female, not the Moon. When the Moon is referred to as "she", it is meant, and should be understood, to be poetic, not literal. The Moon itself has no reproductive faculty to be fecundated. <br>
<br>
The German word for moon, "der Mond", is male. <br>
It is the linguistic gender of the word which is male, not the object which it names, the Moon. This linguistic gender facilitates usage within the context of language. "Der Mond" has no reproductive faculty and is not understood as being able to fecundate.<br>
<br>

<h4>
<b>Some Bantered Words</b>
</h4>
<br>

As is often the problem with all translations, using the meaning from a modern language, for a foreign or ancient word, has the flaw of misleading the reader into thinking that the word has always actually meant that which a modern localised interpretation has on offer. Some translators make attempt to be more poetic so as to bring across a feeling for a concept or expression but that remains totally subjective and opinionated. Others try the path of literal translation of each and every word but that is not only somewhat stilted, it is also tainted by meanings which were modified over the course of time such that the latest meaning is adopted.
<br><br>

Many of these conversions distort text so extremely that the reader is left with a rather unsettling impression that astrology, for instance, is a static science which is impervious to change. Take for instance the scholars studying the ancient texts who "know" that the word <i>"horoskopos"</i> means "horoscope" in the modern sense of "fortune telling". Whenever they encountered that word in an ancient text, a bell rang, and then the ancient world was full of superstition in the form of fortune telling. Nowadays, of course, academics are better informed and wouldn't make such a mistake but their authoritative references still contain those errors which are sadly perpetuated.

Of course, all this has come to the attention of some conscientious scholars, and just like with Hermetism itself, will soon be lost and await rediscovery by a new generation of inquisitive thinkers. <br>

 For instance:

<div class="quo dkgreen">
<i>
A third example is the Greek term "horoskopos" which denotes the
degree (or entire sign) of the zodiac that is rising in the East. It goes back to the Egyptian habit of time-keeping at night by observing the part of the zodiac (or, more precisely, the decanal deity) that was rising in the East and “watching (and thereby indicating) the hour” (oro + skopos). Since this data was in the opinion of Hellenistic astrologers on the shores of the Nile the most important astronomical element of a nativity, it later came to denote – by way of pars pro toto – the entire birth chart, giving rise to the modern term "horoscope". However, this extended notion is post-ancient and not attested in Greco-Roman sources. 34 An emic translation of "horoskopos" is “hour-watcher”. Less preferable, but closer to modern terminology is "ascendant".

There are quite a number of technical terms used in ancient texts, the meanings of which seem to be either lost or reinterpreted over the course of time. Many of these relate to a division of the ecliptic into twelve sections.

<b>Loci</b><br>
The twelve horoscopic places (dōdekatropos, δωδεκάτροπος).<br>
The loci are twelfth divisions of the ecliptic, of 30 degrees each, marked off around the zodiac in the same order as the signs, starting from an important point such as the ascendant, or the lot of fortune. When starting from the ascendant, they are the same as modern day "equal house" divisions. In ancient times their meaning was quite specific and somewhat different from that of the modern houses:<br>

The Greek word <i>"topos (τόπος)"</i> means place, topic, or theme (hence its usage in English as 'topic'). The concept is known as a 'house' in modern astrology

<b>Dodekatemoria</b><br>
The <i>dodekatemoria (δωδεκατημόρια)</i> are twelfth divisions of each of the twelve signs of the zodiac. Therefore, in the circle of the ecliptic, there are altogether 144 dodekatemoria. Each is 2.5° in longitude of the ecliptic. As has been pointed out by Lis Brack-Bernsen in <i>The Babylonian Dodecatemoria and Calendar Texts</i>, each of those twelfth divisions of a sign schematically aligns with the moon throughout the month which aligns with each sign in Babylonian reckoning. The Babylonian astronomy/astrology was closely aligned to their calendar and much of their observational mathematics was used to calculate phenomena in time as well as space.
<br><br>

1. 9. A HANDY METHOD FOR NEW AND FULL MOONS
For example: Mesore 2, the Sun in Leo 5°, the Moon in Libra 26°. The distance from the Sun to the Moon is 81°, which is very nearly 7 dodekatemoria. Therefore, the Moon is seven days past the conjunction. Next, I deduct the 7 from 54 the Sun’s position and arrive at Cancer 28°. The previous new Moon occurred there. From Mesore 2 I subtract 7; the result is Epiphi 25. If we add 15 to Cancer 28° the result is Leo 13°. The full Moon will be at Aquarius 13°.
<br><br>
Calculate the full Moon as follows: assume Mechir 13, the Sun in Aquarius 22°, the Moon in Scorpio 7°. I take the distance from the point opposite the Sun, Leo 22°, to the Moon’s position; this is
75°, which equals 6 dodekatemoria. I subtract this from Leo 22°. The result is Leo 16°, where the full Moon occurred. Again, I subtract the 6 dodekatemoria from Mechir 13, for a result of Mechir 7. Since from the conjunction to the full Moon there are 15 days, I add the 8 [days from Mechir 7 to Mechir 13] to this 13, and get 21. Therefore, the Moon is that many days [21] from new.

Michael Zellmann-Rohrer - The Chronokratores in Greek Astrology<br>
Chronokratores in Greek Astrology, in Light of a New Papyrus Text<br>
471<br>
<br>
The Sun, for daytime births, or the Moon, for nighttime births, occupies the first period in the cycle and the first subdivision within it, while the order among the subsequent planets follows their position along the zodiac-ecliptic in the geniture. This system is found already in Ptolemy’s near contemporary Vettius Valens, who devotes a chapter to “the division of propitious and unpropitious time-periods into ten years and nine months” (Περὶ τῆς εἰς ιʹ ἔτη καὶ μῆνας θʹ διαιρέσεως ἐμπράκτων τε καὶ ἀπράκτων, Anthologiae 6.6). 10 Here Valens presents himself as bringing order to confused and haphazard accounts among his predecessors, who are not named. The term χρονοκράτωρ is not introduced until partway through the description, the planets being called instead “releasers” (ἀφέται) at the outset. A further development is the subdivision into analogous periods for hours, days, and months (ὡριαῖοι, ἡμερήσιοι, μηνιαῖοι) in addition to years (ἐνιαύσιοι) (6.6.6).
<br><br>

Also considered is the moderation of effects of the chronokratores themselves by the agency of the planets directly preceding and following in the succession (κατὰ τὴν τοῦ παραδιδόντος καὶ παραλαμβάνοντος ἐνέργειαν καὶ διάθεσιν οἰκείαν ἢ ἐναντίαν, 6.6.7). Valens closes with a sample geniture, a nighttime birth where the zodiacal positions give the succession Moon, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Sun, Mercury, with a sample prediction for 15 Pauni (8 June) in the 53rd year of the native’s life.

Mystery Surrounding the Elements and the Signs For the past 20 years there has been something of a mystery surrounding how the four classical elements came to be assigned to the specific signs of the zodiac that they are associated with in the Medieval and Modern traditions of astrology.

In their 1993 translation of Book I of Vettius Valens’Anthology, Robert Schmidt and Robert Hand pointed out that Valens is the earliest Hellenistic author to mention these now-familiar associations between the four elements and the signs of the zodiac.17 For example, Valens says that Aries is fiery, Taurus is earthy, Gemini is airy, Cancer is watery, and so on. He does so in a way that makes it seem as if he is he was getting the associations from an earlier source,though, since Valens appears to take the associations for granted, as if they were common knowledge in his time. Schmidt points out that elsewhere in the Anthology Valens tends to let the reader know when he is innovating, which implies that it was not Valens himself who introduced this element-sign relationship.

The correspondences to parts of the body are already correlated by Vettius Valens to the planets:
<br><br>

<b>Vettius Valens, Book 1 : <br>1. THE NATURE OF THE STARS</b>
<br><br>

Moon<br>
The Moon rules the parts of the body as follows: the left eye, the stomach, the breasts, the breath, the spleen, the<br>
dura mater, the marrow (as a result it causes dropsy/moist syndromes).

Of the parts of the body, it rules the hands, the shoulders, the fingers, the joints, the belly, the sense of hearing, the arteries, 6 the intestines, the tongue.
<br><br>
Venus<br>
Of the parts of the body, it rules the neck, the face, the lips, the sense of smell, the front parts from the feet to the head, the parts of intercourse;<br>
Of the inner parts 4 it rules the lungs.<br>
It is a recipient of support from others and of pleasure.
<br><br>
Sun<br>
Of the parts of the body, the Sun rules the head;<br>
Of the sense organs, it rules the right eye;<br>
Of the trunk, it rules the heart;<br>
Of the spiritual (i.e. the perceptive) faculties, the nerves.
<br><br>
Mars<br>
Of the body parts, Mars rules the head, the seat, the genitals;<br>
Of the internal parts, it rules the blood, the sperm ducts, the bile, the elimination of excrement, the parts in the rear, the back, and the underside. It controls the hard and the abrupt.
<br><br>
Jupiter<br>
Of the external body parts, it rules the thighs and the feet. (Consequently, in the games Jupiter governs the race.)<br>
Of the internal parts it rules the sperm, the uterus, the liver, the parts of the right<br>
side.
<br><br>
Saturn<br>
Of the limbs of the body, it rules the legs, the knees, the tendons, the lymph, the phlegm, the bladder, the<br>
kidneys, and the internal, hidden organs.<br>
Saturn is indicative of injuries arising from cold and moisture, such as dropsy, neuralgia, gout, cough,<br>
dysentery, hernia, spasms.
<br><br>
<br>



<b>Vettius Valens, Book 2 : <br>36. INJURIES AND DISEASES</b>
<br><br>

In part 36 of Book 2 of the Anthologies, Valens firstly complains about the ancients being obscure over the topic of injuries to the body and proceeds to clarify the issue for the reader. Once again his technique starts with Tyche (Lot of Fortune) and Daimon (Lot of Spirit) and the 30 degree divisions around the ecliptic starting from those points in the chart. Those from Tyche relate to external body parts and those from Daimon, the internals:

<h1 class="title"><span>Daimons in Hermetical Astrology</span></h1>

<div style="float:right; text-align: center; width:25%; margin:6px 0px 0px 20px;" >
<img src="img/daimon/daimon.jpg" alt="" class="modal-img" onclick="clk(this)" style="width:100%; border-radius: 8px;">
</div>


One of the most Hermetic areas of interest in Astrology lies within the field of <i>Planetary Daimons</i> for they are fundamental to both the Technical and Philosophical Hermetic literature. In ancient Greece, <i>Daimons</i> were placed somewhere between the Divine and the Natural, in effect being regarded as half-gods or demi-gods.
<br><br>

The word <i>daimōn</i> (Ancient Greek: δαίμων) denotes negative or positive planetary energy (energeia, actuality) or force (dynamis, potentiality). It is also characteristic of particular places derived from planetary positions in an astrological chart, as well as being attached to certain houses, namely the 5th and the 11th. 
<br><br>

In Hermetic Philosophy, a person's Good Daimon (<i>eudaimon</i> or <i>agathos daimon</i>), is a guiding spirit, which accompanies the soul to its earthly incarnation, stays with it throughout life and finally escorts it back to the outer spheres upon death. In Latin, that Daimon is known as a person's <i>Genius</i>, and in theology as a <i>Guardian Angel.</i> These ideas were prominent in early philosophy such as that of Plato (c.427–348 BC).
<br><br>


<div class="lboxc" style="width:30%; margin: 4px 20px 10px 0px; " >

</div>



Extremely ancient horoscopes have recently surfaced due to the hard work of diligent historians piecing together fragments of manuscripts from various locations, previously thought to be unrelated. These charts contain delineations in a similar manner to modern astrology and place the great importance on the calculable daimons and their meaning.
<br><br>

There are a few linguistic or technical difficulties which arise with the use of the word <i>daimon</i>. Firstly, according to the Hermetic texts, everyone has a personal daimon accompanying the soul from the cosmos into the body at birth and again away from the body back to the cosmos after death. This daimon is sometimes found astrologically. But according to the gnostic version, the departed soul of an enlightened being is accompanied by the daimon of each planetary sphere upon reaching that level on its way out of the physical realm. So, in that gnostic version what happens to the personal daimon during the ascent? Does it clash with the planetary daimon?
<br><br>

Secondly, the word <i>daimon</i> is not only the name of a particular calculable "lot" or "fate" in an astrological chart, it is also the name used for all of the lots or fates. Therefore the lot of the sun, the part of spirit, should be known as the "daimon of daimon". Likewise, the lot of the moon, the part of fortune, should really be the "daimon of tyche". As well as that, the last two astrological houses are also called daimon. So it is rather difficult to keep these frames of reference apart, especially if a Hermetic practitioner wished to include all of these in a chart.
<br><br>

There is a third problem and that is with the word <i>"demon"</i>,  derived from <i>daimon</i>. "The term [demon} had first acquired its negative connotations in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, which drew on the mythology of ancient Semitic religions" (wikipedia). This occurred around the 3rd century BCE when Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–247 BCE) requested seventy-two Hebrew translators, supposedly six from each of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, perform the translation. At that time there was also a lot of attention paid by these scholars to gnosticism with its view of a world filled with evil. This dualistic notion had been carried over from Zoroastrianism by those same semitic scholars. Undoubtedly these ideas later formed the foundation for Christianity which inherited those evil demons, holus-bolus.

<h6>Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche</h6>

In the ancient Greek world there is a lot of mythology surrounding our subject. <i>Agathos Daimon</i> (Greek: ἀγαθός δαίμων), sometimes Agathodaimon, meaning "noble spirit" often appeared with his spouse or companion, <i>Agathe Tyche</i> (Greek: Ἀγαθὴ Τύχη), "good fortune". As early as the 5th C. BCE, Agathos Daimon was depicted as a snake and remained popular as a protective spirit for personal houses, and to which ritual offerings were made following every meal. As has been pointed out by some historians, this probably had a practical nature with snakes being known to destroy vermin.
<br><br>

In Ptolemaic Egypt (305-30 BCE), Agathos Daimon was the guardian of Alexandria and equated with Shai, the ancient Egyptian god of destiny, also depicted as a snake. In Greco-Roman Egypt (332 BCE - 395 CE), these two figures, Agathos Daimon and Shai were merged into the primordial snake called Kneph. 



The Graeco-Egyptian god, Serapis, popularised in the 3rd C. BCE by orders of the Greek Pharaoh Ptolomy was often depicted as having a male Greek looking head and the body of a snake. This successfully shifted attention away from Egyptian gods and onto the Greek, and bizarrely absorbed into the god <i>"Serapis Amun Agathodaemon"</i>.
<br><br>

Traditionally <i>daimon</i> is taken to mean spirit while <i>tyche</i> as fortune or luck. 
<br><br>

The word <i>daimon</i>, like <i>dynamis</i> can mean force or potential, or what could be, as opposed to the domain of <i>energeia</i> or <i>tyche</i> as fortune and what already has happened to be. 
<!--DGG p102-->
<br><br>

In Hermetic Astrology, the 11th "house" (twelfth of the ecliptic) is known as the <i>Good Spirit (agathos daimon)</i> and the 12th "house" as the <i>Bad Spirit (kaka daimon)</i>. Similarly, the 5th "house" is known as <i>Good Fortune (agathos tyche)</i> and the 6th "house" as <i>Bad Fortune (kaka tyche)</i>. These are used extensively in birth charts to determine the destiny of the native. In medical astrology they assist with the prognosis and outcome of an illness.

<h4>
<b>Vettius Valens on Conception</b>
<br>
<span>
(The Prenatal Epoch in Hermetical Astrology)
</span>
</h4>
<br>


The prenatal epoch is purportedly a means by which to gain a more accurate birth time, called rectification, of the chart. It was first mentioned in a text from about the tenth century called the Centiloquium,  the most influential book ever on astrology.

Originally attributed to Claudius Ptolemy  (Greek: Πτολεμαῖος, Ptolemaios; Latin: Claudius Ptolemaeus; c. 100 – c. 170 AD) and known as the Centiloquium of Ptolemy for many centuries, it has more likely been written in the Arab world some nine centuries after Ptolomy.

The particular aphorism which is of interest is number fifty-one and generally referred to as the Trutine of Hermes Trismegistus.

<br>

<h5><b>Plato, the Daimon and Birth</b></h5>

<i>In the “Myth of Er,” which concludes the Republic, Plato outlines the process by which the discarnate soul is paired with its Daimon who guides its descent through the planetary spheres, as it takes on the planetary qualities corresponding to each sphere (such as the vices and virtues) and, finally, is coupled with a body at the pre-natal syzygy (the new or full moon immediately preceding birth) and is, finally, incarnated in the elemental/terrestrial sphere of Earth.<br>
<br>
This descending sequence alludes to an inverse operation – one in which the soul of the initiate ascends, with the help of its Daimon (Guardian Angel, Oikodespotes, Higher Genius, Tutelary Spirit, etc.) and aided by theurgical rites, through the cosmic spheres and re-integrates with the One, attaining the state of henosis/gnosis/theosis, depending on the tradition in question.<br>
<br></i>

- Written By Jaime Paul Lamb

<br>


<h5><b>Calculation of the Prenatal Epoch</b></h5>

The 51st Centiloquium of Ptolemy describes it thus:
“In what sign the Moon is at the time of birth, make that sign the ascendant in conception; and in what sign she is found at the conception, make that or its opposite the sign ascending at the birth.” 
	

<h5><b>Getting the estimated epoch</b></h5>

<pre>
first get the longitude (lon) of estimated epoch's ascendant (asc) and moon
waxing birth moon: birth moon lon = epoch1 ASC  lon  ( so ASC = MOON)
                   birth ASC  lon = epoch1 moon lon  (and MOON = ASC)
waning birth moon: birth moon lon = epoch1 DESC lon  ( so ASC = MOON + 180)
                   birth DESC lon = epoch1 moon lon  (and MOON = ASC + 180)

Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practitioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
