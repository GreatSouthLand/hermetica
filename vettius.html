Marble Roman copy of Eutychides' Tyche of Antioch. This sculpture is full of symbols and metaphor. The female figure represents the luck or good fortune, Tyche, of the city of Antioch, in modern Turkey. She is seated on a rock, with her feet on a swimming male figure (a personification of the river Orontes), both symbols of the city’s topography. She holds a sheaf of wheat representing prosperity, and wears a turreted crown symbolising security. The statue was discovered in Rome, in Via Latina.

<h1 class="title" >Vettius Valens - Interpreting Charts </h1>

Vettius Valens (08.02.120-07.184 CE) was a Hellenistic astrologer who authored the <i>"Anthologies" (ἀνθολογίαι)</i>, a textbook style set of astrological instructions written in the second century CE, nine volumes of which have survived. Rumours have it that there could have been ten or twelve altogether. The content is unusual, not only because Valens was a practicing Hermetic astrologer who describes his methods in great detail, but also because he provides over 130 horoscopes pertaining to the ancient world. The descriptions have proved to be astronomically accurate and informative, both astrologically and historically. In fact they represent almost the entirety of ancient horoscopes remaining from that era. Outside those, only five others are to be found before the year 380 CE. He also includes a chart which is very likely his own.
<br><br>

According to some of his biographers, Vettius Valens was a native of Antioch in ancient Syria, which is now Antakya in Turkey. After much travelling in search of knowledge, which he claimed was unreliable, he is said to have later moved to Egypt. It has been claimed that he settled in the larger city of Alexandria founded by Alexander the Great which was the famed center of learning at the time, and commercially more advantageous for his astrology. This is supposedly where he eventually wrote The Anthologies as a text book for his students.
<br><br>

The Anthologies were written sometime between the years 150 and 175 CE and were in use for at least thirteen centuries throughout the dark and middle ages up to the renaissance. Unlike the <i>Tetrabiblos (also known as Apotelesmatika)</i> from Claudius Ptolomy, which also was in use for as many centuries, The Anthologies was written from the point of view and experience of an actively professional astrologer, whereas Ptolomy, who was simply a compiler of the theories of the time, was neither an astrologer nor particularly familiar with the subject in a practical manner.
<br><br>

It has often been mentioned that the techniques used by Valens differed significantly from that of his contemporary, Ptolomy. This is easily explained by the fact that Valens was a Hermetic astrologer and his knowledge was based on a different set of theories and techniques. By carefully studying The Anthologies, much is revealed as to what those unique methods were. Because this was the subject of much study for so long, it is not too surprising that a lot of this material has entered into mainstream astrology still being practised today. Some have taken the Hermetic nature of his work to be of Stoic origin, overlooking how much Stoicism was influenced by Hermeticism.
<br><br>

Especially when it comes to Valens, the Hermetic peculiarities in his astrology, are still puzzling philologists, historians and astrologers who are unable to borrow from preconceived ideas with the intention of 'correcting' any errors they 'discover' in his old texts, justifying their method through claims that the texts have experienced transcription errors over time. Thus, many ancient texts have been modified so extensively that their importance has suffered. Luckily, The Anthologies, at least since the Byzantine (395–1453 CE), seems to have been spared much of this fate.
<br><br>


<h6>Sources</h6>


<b>The Sources of Vettius Valens</b> 
<br><br>

Valens says that his astronomical material was sourced from the astronomers Hipparchus and Apollonius, as well as for data of the sun and moon, the Babylonians named Kidenas and Soudines. He also mentions that he studied the "ancient astrologers", namely the legendary Egyptian astrologers, King Nechepso and the Sage Petosiris. Critodemus, of the first century, is also high on his list. 
<br><br>


<b>The Sources of the Translators</b> 
<br><br>

The texts which were used for modern translations of Vettius Valens,  came from two sources, both in Greek, with Latin prefaces and footnotes. The earlier one was from Wilhelm Kroll, dated 1908. The other was from David Pingree, and published in 1986. The first English translations of The Anthologies were made by Robert Schmidt and ran from 1993 to 2001 in a series from Robert Hand's Golden Hind Press. The earliest translation into German appeared in 2004 under the title of <i>Blütensträusse</i> by Otto Schönberger and Eberhard Knobloch. Finally, the most recent translation into English was by Professor Mark Riley who made it available on the internet in 2010 and now in book form published by Chris Brennan.
<br><br>

In 1959, the mathematician, Otto Neugebauer (1899-1990), together with the scholar and librarian, Henry Bartlett van Hoesen (1885-1965), published <i>Greek Horoscopes</i>, which was a collection of literary data found in ancient manuscripts. They were the first to mention the importance of the writings of Vettius Valens as supplying reliable information regarding the astronomical methods employed by an astrologer of the ancient world. Even though the dates were not specifically mentioned, the two researchers managed to verify his astronomical data by what Valens had mentioned in his astrology.
<br><br>

Nevertheless, despite their good intentions and rigorous scholastic approach, on page 10 of <i>Greek Horoscopes</i> is an example of the type of confident false assumption, backed up by unrelated fact, written about the word <i>"phase" (φάσή)</i> supposedly as it was used in <i>The Anthologies</i>:<br>

<div class="quo vdgreen">
<!--
Phase<br>
-->
The concept of "phase" is <u>probably</u> derived from the observation of bright fixed stars. In the Greek calendars the characteristic risings and settings of stars are listed in their relation to the seasons. These first or last appearances in the morning or evening are called the "phases."

<!--
Ptolemy's páσes åπλavŵv åσтéρwv kai σvv- αγωγὴ ἐπισημασίων were edited by Heiberg in the Opera astronomica minora of Ptolemy and discussed by H. Vogt in part V of the Griechische Kalender edited by Boll.

The corresponding "phases" of the planets are, of course, not in a fixed relation to the seasons.

Their computation is discussed in the Almagest XIII,7-9. Tables are given in the Almagest XIII,10. More extensive tables were contained in the Handy Tables (Heiberg p. 174, Halma I p. 15). It follows from the horoscopes that this problem was already dealt with in the time before Ptolemy.
-->
</div>

as well as on pages 27 and 28:
<br>

<div class="quo vdgreen">
<!--ASTROLOGICAL COMMENTARY
<br>
Col. I
<br>
-->
"Phase." This term is used here in a much looser sense than ordinarily (cf., Introduction p. 10). Mercury at superior conjunction is said to have completed its phase." <u>This can only mean</u> that its "phase" as morning star is ended.


<!--
This is confirmed by the other cases which obviously concern the "phases" mentioned here in the introduction of the horoscope.

Saturn is I said to rise before dawn and Venus is mentioned as morning star but neither one of these planets is in a specific position of a "phase" in the strict sense of this term. For the astrological significance of the phases cf. Bouché-Leclercq, AG p. 309, IV; also p. 113 note 1.
-->
</div>

<br>
Both of these are incorrect and the meaning of the word "phase"  (φάσή) fits better the meaning used on the page <a href="cycles.htm">&raquo; Cycles and Phases</a>.

<h6>Greek Horoscopes</h6>

In 1959, the mathematician, Otto Neugebauer (1899-1990), together with the scholar and librarian, Henry Bartlett van Hoesen (1885-1965), published <i>Greek Horoscopes</i>, which was a collection of literary data found in ancient manuscripts.

<h6>Hero of the Day</h6>

There is evidence (from the research of Ilaria Bultrighini and Sacha Stern) that the very first mention of a seven day week was made in the City of Rome during the first century of the Common Era (CE). It remained isolated within the city for some time, making little impact on the outside world. This contradicts the current idea that the seven day week was invented by Babylonian, Egyptian or Hellenist astronomers, for which there is no evidence whatsoever.
<br><br>

Vettius Valens, in the Greco-Roman world at the eastern edge of the Mediterranean, was the first person to explain the origin of the names of the seven week-days. Unlike how is now claimed about the weekdays gaining their names from a seven pointed star crossing from one side to another, which does indeed work, the names of the days were actually derived by another means.
<br><br>

That a month has four weeks, each of seven days, is related to the cycle of the moon, from which the word "month" is derived. These four weeks are related to the four main phases in the cycle of new moon, first quarter, full moon and last quarter. These are fundamental to lunar calendars to keep track of time.
<br><br>

Since each day has twenty-four hours, a week has altogether 168 hours (7 x 24). These hours have been astrologically assigned planetary rulers in what is known as the Chaldean Order of distances from the earth and times taken to travel through the Zodiac, in order of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. 
<br><br>

Each day in the Roman Empire at the time started at sunrise and the first day of the week was given Saturn as its ruler, the first of the planets in order. Each hour that followed after was given as its ruler, the next planet in order. Therefore the second hour after sunrise on the first day of the week had Jupiter as its ruler, and so on through all the planets and then repeating the sequence.
<br><br>

At the beginning of the second day, the ruler was the Sun, and so that day became the Sun day. The geginning of the third day was ruled by the Moon and became the Moon day, and so on through the seven days.
<br><br>




<hr class="leaf">




<h6>Time Lords</h6>


Vettius Valens was also the first person to systematically use the <i>Time Lords (chronokratores, χρονοκράτορες)</i>, the rulers of cyclical and sequential periods which occur throughout human life and whose calculation covers the span of life. 
<br><br>

The <i>Time Lords</i> were used in Egyptian astrology before the time of Valens but their origin, and the logic behind them, has since been lost. A number of different methods have been used to discover the ruler of a particular part of life, and more recently have (supposedly) become a modern technique known as (yearly) <i>profections</i>. What he does mention is that someone named Abraham was an authority on the distribution of operative <i>chronocratorship</i> in relation to the <i>Lot of Daimon</i>. 

Even though Valens talks extensively about <i>Time Lords</i>, starting at Book I 21, he doesn't actually introduce the subject before using the term, as if it didn't require introduction. Some have noted that this could be because it was such common practice at the time that it this would have been unnecessary. 
<br><br>

At Anthologies IV 14, there is the first mention of the lengths of rulerships with Saturn as 30 years, Jupiter 12, Mars 15, Sun 19, Venus 8, Mercury 20 and Moon 25. At this point Valens mentions that someone he calls "The King", who is probably the legendary "King Nechepso", introduced in his 13th book, the Lot of Fortune as being the "Ruling Place", a point from which the length of life may be determined.
<br><br>

Book IV of Anthologies starts under the title of <i>The Distributions of Periods</i>. Here Valens has taken the rulerships according to years and converted them for so many months as they previously were for years. In this way, the <i>Time Lords</i>, according to the 10-year 9-month system as it is called in Book III 9, are assigned to 129 month periods divided between the planets in order.
<br><br>

He said:

<div class="quo vdgreen">
<i>
We believe that we have set forth an appropriate, in fact, magisterial, explanation of the previous [theorems].
We will now reveal a topic investigated by many and hidden from view, namely the distribution of propitious
and impropitious times. We must preface our discussion with the distributions which have been proven by our
own experience. The primary period is one-fourth of the minimum period, as follows:
</i>

<br>

<!--
According to Anthologies Book IV 1, the <i>Time Lords</i>, (according to the 10-year 9-month system as it is called in Book III 9) are assigned to 129 month periods divided between the planets in order:

<br>

Therefore, the first 30 months of life has Saturn as the <i>Time Lord</i>. The next 12 months has Jupiter as its <i>Time Lord</i>, and so on up to the end of the first 129 months by which time all of the first set of periods have occurred and then the cycle repeats. Each of these cycles is 129 months, or 10 years and 9 months, in length.

<br><br>
<br>

<b>Three Score Years and Ten</b>
<br>
The expression <i>Three Score Years and Ten</i> is derived from one of the methods for determining <i>Time Lords</i>. By this system, known from Shakespeare as the "Seven Ages of Man", human life is allocated seven periods according to the seven planets in order, and totalling 70 years altogether.

<h6>Language and Gender</h6>


The words "feminine" and "masculine" are very often used in astrology and Vettius Valens uses them a lot to denote specific qualities and tendencies. Although always done for convenience, they should never be understood to mean the same as when biologically referring to humans. The idea of intermingling these ideas should also be avoided. To help with understanding these symbols, it is perhaps advisable to adopt an attitude that they are specialist terms with specialist meanings.
<br><br>

Anthologies Book I 12. Masculine and Feminine Degrees:
<br>
<div class="quo vdgreen">
The masculine and feminine degrees are as follows: the first 2&frac12; degrees of the masculine signs are masculine, the next 2&frac12; degrees are feminine. The first 2&frac12; degrees of feminine signs are feminine, the next 2&frac12; degrees are masculine, the next 2&frac12; are feminine. <!--The degree of the new moon will be indicative for new-moon births; the degree of the full moon will be indicative for full-moon births. Others say that the degree in which the Ascendant or the moon falls… -->
</div>
<br>




The concept of "feminine", in astrology, is also referred to as "negative", another problematic word when taken to mean the same as in common use. The actual meaning within astrology is that of being receptive, perceptive, open, creative, considerate, sensitive, and so forth. If anything, the popular human female stereotype could gain from acquiring more of the astrological symbolism. Lastly, "feminine" is more akin to the concept of "yin" in eastern philosophy, and it is there, that a lot more insight may be gained.
<br><br>

The concepts of "negative" and "positive" are more closely related to the terms as used in the physics of electricity, describing the direction of a current, or perhaps in the eastern philosophy of "yin and yang", than they are as to what they mean in psychology with its judgemental overloading.
<br><br>

The concept of "masculine" in astrology is also referred to as "positive". This can be confusing when not understood within its astrological context. Astrologically, "masculine" actually means outgoing, demonstrative, confident, focused, willing, studious, insightful and so forth. Once again, the male stereotype could likely benefit from absorbing more of the astrological symbolism, rather than relying so much, on the claims of psychology. The eastern concept of "yang" can also yield some greater insights.
<br><br>

Finally, in astrology, nothing is only "feminine" or "masculine", for they are tendencies. There is always a mix of their characteristics. Sometimes an astrologer might describe someone, or something, as more feminine, or more masculine but this only refers to the summation of all the elements, themes and chords under consideration, mainly to assist in portraying an overall impression.
<br><br>


<b>Two Examples</b>
<br><br>

1. The Sign of Taurus, the Bull, is female. <br>
It is the astrological gender of the Sign which is female, and not Taurus or the Bull. When an astrologer refers to Taurus as female, it is understood that it is the "Sign of Taurus" being addressed.<br>
<br>
The animal known as the Bull, is male. <br>
It is the biological gender of the animal which is male. When people speak of a bull, it is understood to mean some male animal. <br>
<br><br>

2. The Symbol of the Moon is female. <br>
It is the astrological gender of the symbol which is female, not the Moon. When the Moon is referred to as "she", it is meant, and should be understood, to be poetic, not literal. The Moon itself has no reproductive faculty to be fecundated. <br>
<br>
The German word for moon, "der Mond", is male. <br>
It is the linguistic gender of the word which is male, not the object which it names, the Moon. This linguistic gender facilitates usage within the context of language. "Der Mond" has no reproductive faculty and is not understood as being able to fecundate.<br>
<br>

</div>


<h6>Some Bantered Words</h6>

As is often the problem with all translations, using the meaning from a modern language, for a foreign or ancient word, has the flaw of misleading the reader into thinking that the word has always actually meant that which a modern localised interpretation has on offer. Some translators make attempt to be more poetic so as to bring across a feeling for a concept or expression but that remains totally subjective and opinionated. Others try the path of literal translation of each and every word but that is not only somewhat stilted, it is also tainted by meanings which were modified over the course of time such that the latest meaning is adopted.
<br><br>

Many of these conversions distort text so extremely that the reader is left with a rather unsettling impression that astrology, for instance, is a static science which is impervious to change. Take for instance the scholars studying the ancient texts who "know" that the word <i>"horoskopos"</i> means "horoscope" in the modern sense of "fortune telling". Whenever they encountered that word in an ancient text, a bell rang, and then the ancient world was full of superstition in the form of fortune telling. Nowadays, of course, academics are better informed and wouldn't make such a mistake but their authoritative references still contain those errors which are sadly perpetuated.

Of course, all this has come to the attention of some conscientious scholars, and just like with Hermetism itself, will soon be lost and await rediscovery by a new generation of inquisitive thinkers. <br>

 For instance:

A third example is the Greek term "horoskopos" which denotes the
degree (or entire sign) of the zodiac that is rising in the East. It goes back to the Egyptian habit of time-keeping at night by observing the part of the zodiac (or, more precisely, the decanal deity) that was rising in the East and “watching (and thereby indicating) the hour” (oro + skopos). Since this data was in the opinion of Hellenistic astrologers on the shores of the Nile the most important astronomical element of a nativity, it later came to denote – by way of pars pro toto – the entire birth chart, giving rise to the modern term "horoscope". However, this extended notion is post-ancient and not attested in Greco-Roman sources. 34 An emic translation of "horoskopos" is “hour-watcher”. Less preferable, but closer to modern terminology is "ascendant".

An ayanamsha is calculated by using the time elapsed
between any given event and the date when the signs
and constellations coincided in 0° Aries. The American
Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, gives the formula
for calculating the rate of precession for any calendar
year as 50.2564" plus T (minus 1900), times
0.000222". In this formula, 'T" means the calendar
year for which the precession is desired.

<h6>Signs, Houses, Loci, Places, Phases, Faces, Dodekatemoria</h6>

There are quite a number of technical terms used in ancient texts, the meanings of which seem to be either lost or reinterpreted over the course of time. Many of these relate to a division of the ecliptic into twelve sections.
<br><br>

<b>Signs</b><br>
The twelfth division of the zodiac, known as the ecliptic, through which the planets course.
<br><br>

<b>Houses</b><br>
In ancient astrology, the house of a planet was where the planet was naturally at home. <br>
This was the masculine (+ve) or feminine (-ve) sign of the zodiac which a planet rules:
<br><br>

<b>Loci</b><br>
The twelve horoscopic places (dōdekatropos, δωδεκάτροπος).<br>
The loci are twelfth divisions of the ecliptic, of 30 degrees each, marked off around the zodiac in the same order as the signs, starting from an important point such as the ascendant, or the lot of fortune. When starting from the ascendant, they are the same as modern day "equal house" divisions. In ancient times their meaning was quite specific and somewhat different from that of the modern houses:<br>
<ul class="list1 dkgreen">

<li>1. horoscope/ascendant (horoskopos, ὡροσκόπος) (angular); also helm; also body, spirit or breath; life.</li>

<li>2. (succedent, epanaforá, ἐπαναφορά); also gate of Hades; livelihood, property, partnership, intercourse with women, business, profit from inheritance.</li>

<li>3. (cadent, apoclima, ἀπόκλιμα); also goddess (moon); cadent place facing a kentra, brothers living abroad, royalty, wealth, friends, relatives, slaves</li>

</ul>

<br>




<b>Places</b>
<br>

The Greek word <i>"topos (τόπος)"</i> means place, topic, or theme (hence its usage in English as 'topic'). The concept is known as a 'house' in modern astrology

<b>Dodekatemoria</b><br>
The <i>dodekatemoria (δωδεκατημόρια)</i> are twelfth divisions of each of the twelve signs of the zodiac. Therefore, in the circle of the ecliptic, there are altogether 144 dodekatemoria. Each is 2.5° in longitude of the ecliptic. As has been pointed out by Lis Brack-Bernsen in <i>The Babylonian Dodecatemoria and Calendar Texts</i>, each of those twelfth divisions of a sign schematically aligns with the moon throughout the month which aligns with each sign in Babylonian reckoning. The Babylonian astronomy/astrology was closely aligned to their calendar and much of their observational mathematics was used to calculate phenomena in time as well as space.
<br><br>

1. 9. A HANDY METHOD FOR NEW AND FULL MOONS
For example: Mesore 2, the Sun in Leo 5°, the Moon in Libra 26°. The distance from the Sun to the Moon is 81°, which is very nearly 7 dodekatemoria. Therefore, the Moon is seven days past the conjunction. Next, I deduct the 7 from 54 the Sun’s position and arrive at Cancer 28°. The previous new Moon occurred there. From Mesore 2 I subtract 7; the result is Epiphi 25. If we add 15 to Cancer 28° the result is Leo 13°. The full Moon will be at Aquarius 13°.
<br><br>
Calculate the full Moon as follows: assume Mechir 13, the Sun in Aquarius 22°, the Moon in Scorpio 7°. I take the distance from the point opposite the Sun, Leo 22°, to the Moon’s position; this is
75°, which equals 6 dodekatemoria. I subtract this from Leo 22°. The result is Leo 16°, where the full Moon occurred. Again, I subtract the 6 dodekatemoria from Mechir 13, for a result of Mechir 7. Since from the conjunction to the full Moon there are 15 days, I add the 8 [days from Mechir 7 to Mechir 13] to this 13, and get 21. Therefore, the Moon is that many days [21] from new.

<h6>Rulers, Exaltations, Chronocrators</h6>


Michael Zellmann-Rohrer - The Chronokratores in Greek Astrology<br>
Chronokratores in Greek Astrology, in Light of a New Papyrus Text<br>
471<br>
<br>
The Sun, for daytime births, or the Moon, for nighttime births, occupies the first period in the cycle and the first subdivision within it, while the order among the subsequent planets follows their position along the zodiac-ecliptic in the geniture. This system is found already in Ptolemy’s near contemporary Vettius Valens, who devotes a chapter to “the division of propitious and unpropitious time-periods into ten years and nine months” (Περὶ τῆς εἰς ιʹ ἔτη καὶ μῆνας θʹ διαιρέσεως ἐμπράκτων τε καὶ ἀπράκτων, Anthologiae 6.6). 10 Here Valens presents himself as bringing order to confused and haphazard accounts among his predecessors, who are not named. The term χρονοκράτωρ is not introduced until partway through the description, the planets being called instead “releasers” (ἀφέται) at the outset. A further development is the subdivision into analogous periods for hours, days, and months (ὡριαῖοι, ἡμερήσιοι, μηνιαῖοι) in addition to years (ἐνιαύσιοι) (6.6.6).
<br><br>

Also considered is the moderation of effects of the chronokratores themselves by the agency of the planets directly preceding and following in the succession (κατὰ τὴν τοῦ παραδιδόντος καὶ παραλαμβάνοντος ἐνέργειαν καὶ διάθεσιν οἰκείαν ἢ ἐναντίαν, 6.6.7). Valens closes with a sample geniture, a nighttime birth where the zodiacal positions give the succession Moon, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Sun, Mercury, with a sample prediction for 15 Pauni (8 June) in the 53rd year of the native’s life.

<h6>Planetary Joys</h6>

The Planetary Joys and the Origins of the
Significations of the Houses and Triplicities (Chris Brennan)
<br>
Mystery Surrounding the Elements and the Signs For the past 20 years there has been something of a mystery surrounding how the four classical elements came to be assigned to the specific signs of the zodiac that they are associated with in the Medieval and Modern traditions of astrology. The standard scheme since late antiquity is as follows:
<br><br>
Aries, Leo, Sagittarius Fire <br>
Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn Earth   <br>
Gemini, Libra, Aquarius Air      <br>
Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces Water   <br>
<br>
In their 1993 translation of Book I of Vettius Valens’Anthology, Robert Schmidt and Robert Hand pointed out that Valens is the earliest Hellenistic author to mention these now-familiar associations between the four elements and the signs of the zodiac.17 For example, Valens says that Aries is fiery, Taurus is earthy, Gemini is airy, Cancer is watery, and so on. He does so in a way that makes it seem as if he is he was getting the associations from an earlier source,though, since Valens appears to take the associations for granted, as if they were common knowledge in his time. Schmidt points out that elsewhere in the Anthology Valens tends to let the reader know when he is innovating, which implies that it was not Valens himself who introduced this element-sign relationship.

<h6>Vettius Valens and Astrological Medicine (Planetary and Zodiacal Melothesia)</h6>

The correspondences to parts of the body are already correlated by Vettius Valens to the planets:
<br><br>

<b>Vettius Valens, Book 1 : <br>1. THE NATURE OF THE STARS</b>
<br><br>

Moon<br>
The Moon rules the parts of the body as follows: the left eye, the stomach, the breasts, the breath, the spleen, the<br>
dura mater, the marrow (as a result it causes dropsy/moist syndromes).
<br><br>
Mercury<br>
Of the parts of the body, it rules the hands, the shoulders, the fingers, the joints, the belly, the sense of hearing, the arteries, 6 the intestines, the tongue.
<br><br>
Venus<br>
Of the parts of the body, it rules the neck, the face, the lips, the sense of smell, the front parts from the feet to the head, the parts of intercourse;<br>
Of the inner parts 4 it rules the lungs.<br>
It is a recipient of support from others and of pleasure.
<br><br>
Sun<br>
Of the parts of the body, the Sun rules the head;<br>
Of the sense organs, it rules the right eye;<br>
Of the trunk, it rules the heart;<br>
Of the spiritual (i.e. the perceptive) faculties, the nerves.
<br><br>
Mars<br>
Of the body parts, Mars rules the head, the seat, the genitals;<br>
Of the internal parts, it rules the blood, the sperm ducts, the bile, the elimination of excrement, the parts in the rear, the back, and the underside. It controls the hard and the abrupt.
<br><br>
Jupiter<br>
Of the external body parts, it rules the thighs and the feet. (Consequently, in the games Jupiter governs the race.)<br>
Of the internal parts it rules the sperm, the uterus, the liver, the parts of the right<br>
side.
<br><br>
Saturn<br>
Of the limbs of the body, it rules the legs, the knees, the tendons, the lymph, the phlegm, the bladder, the<br>
kidneys, and the internal, hidden organs.<br>
Saturn is indicative of injuries arising from cold and moisture, such as dropsy, neuralgia, gout, cough,<br>
dysentery, hernia, spasms.
<br><br>
<br>



<b>Vettius Valens, Book 2 : <br>36. INJURIES AND DISEASES</b>
<br><br>

In part 36 of Book 2 of the Anthologies, Valens firstly complains about the ancients being obscure over the topic of injuries to the body and proceeds to clarify the issue for the reader. Once again his technique starts with Tyche (Lot of Fortune) and Daimon (Lot of Spirit) and the 30 degree divisions around the ecliptic starting from those points in the chart. Those from Tyche relate to external body parts and those from Daimon, the internals:

Wolfgang Hübner also noted on page 249 of <i>

"An Unnoticed zodiacal Melothesia in the text of Vettius Valens" (
"Eine unbeachtete zodiakale Melothesie bei Vettius Valens")</i>
<br>
that there was a mention by Vettius Valens of Planetary Melothesia in a particularly hellenistic form likely originating from Nechepso and Petosiris. The only problem is that he says it is to be found in Book II Part 36, whereas it is actually in Part 37.
<br><br>


Roger Pearse also states on his website (which is not the case) that:
<div class="quo">
Vettius Valens, Anthologies, Book VII, contains the only surviving intact presentation of an important timing procedure that derives directly from the earliest stratum of Hellenistic astrology, employing the periods of the planets and the ascentional times of the zoidia for the direct timing of planetary figures and configurations in a given nativity. Includes a method for investigating life expectancy based on a study of the domicile lord of the Ascendant in tandem with the domicile lord of the Lot of Fortune, supplemented with a study of the conjoinings of the Moon to other planets and a procedure for determining a succession of planets that have primary authority over the native's successes and failures in all areas of life.

Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practitioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
