<h1 class="title">Astrology, Medicine and Hermetism</h1>

Ever since ancient times, Hermetism, and especially its astrological part, has been applied to many fields of human endeavour, most significantly medicine. This section investigates what these originally were at their fullest and most elaborate extent. There is no doubt that medicine constitutes the largest part of applied Hermetism and very likely the reason that astrological techniques were kept alive for so many centuries.
<br><br>

In the middle ages, especially at the University of Bologna, education consisted of two stages or levels of learning that which was known as the seven liberal arts. The first and lower level was known as the <i>Trivium</i>, which were concerned with <i>The Book of Man</i>, whereby the advanced and upper level was called the <i>Quadrivium</i>, and regarded <i>The Book of Nature</i>. 
<br><br>

The trivium, a word coined to imitate the name of the earlier formed quadrivium, set the pace for education by supplying the necessary basic knowledge of grammar, logic, and rhetoric. Once mastered, a student could proceed to the quadrivium to study the advanced subjects mentioned in Plato's Republic as Arithmetic, Music, Geometry and Astronomy/Astrology. These subjects were all of a mathematical nature, with Arithmetic concerning numbers as abstract concepts, Music as numbers in time, Geometry as numbers in space, and Astronomy/Astrology as numbers in space and time.

<br>
As can be seen, medicine was not taught as part of the liberal arts and astrological medicine was a part of astrology, rather than astrology being a part of medicine, as is nowadays claimed. 
<br><br>

A brief mention should be made about what happened to the Hermetic sciences and why they are no longer central to human endeavour. Firstly, the modern world which began in the cradle of modern science, was at the time struggling with religious ideas and fought their battle by declaring all mainstream ideas, which were intertwined with Hermetism, to be rooted in <i>magic</i> and <i>superstition</i>, and therefore bad. 
<br><br>

Everything was then taken over into modern science by reduction or rationalisation into 'scientific' disciplines, renaming them along the way. As a result, magic became physics and alchemy became chemistry. Because astrological medicine was such a broad subject involving many varied fields, it was converted into biology, botany, diagnostics, surgery, pharmacy, medical theory and research as well as large scale agriculture of medicinal plants.
<br><br>

To make things somewhat clearer, when the term 'magic' is used here, it refers to the intentional manipulation of the physical world by often employing unseen agencies or forces. How this differs from alchemy, is that magic more often than not, goes beyond the boundaries of just physical matter, with the intention of also altering the course of events.  Within the framework of medicine, alchemy usually produces medicines to be administered to the patient, whereas magic intends to alter the patient or sickness by supernatural intervention, using particular spells, amulets, incantations and so on. Much of this was developed in the Arab world which inherited its knowledge from the ancient Greeks and Romans and carried its learning into Europe.
<br><br>

What could be more magical or miraculous than a pharmaceutical drug and its invisible actions manifesting effects within and without a patient? The difference in the modern world is the naming of the phenomenon and not the phenomenon itself. The idea and method for modern drugs comes straight out of the <a href="#spagyric"><b><i>&raquo;Hermetic Spagyrics</i></b></a> of <a href="#paracelsus"><b><i>&raquo;Paracelsus</i></b></a> (explained later) but he doesn't get the credit for being a scientist because he didn't use recent scientifically acceptable language. This is strange indeed but this type of hijacking of ideas is part of modern science.
<br><br>

Naturally enough, it stands to reason, that 'magic' as a Hermetic Science, probably doesn't work in the way it is claimed or described. Nevertheless it is intriguing that Hermetism has been around for thousands of years and as some say, there must be something to it, otherwise it would have disappeared like so many other things from the ancient world. The approach here, is to say what it was, and is, and leave it up to each individual to make personal judgements.
<br><br>


<h6>Astrological Medicine</h6>

As a Hermetic Science, Astrological Medicine encompasses a number of fields of human endeavour, including <i>iatromathematika, melothesia, spagyric, rhizomatoi and (occult) botany</i> especially in the form of herbalism. These fields of study have since been pushed into the realms of esoterics, occultism or superstition, mainly because their effects are regarded by self-styled authorities, erroneously, as 'beliefs' which don't belong to any recognised religion.
<br><br>

</div>


The intention of Astrological Medicine is to employ astrological techniques relating to patients and their ailments. This can reveal otherwise overlooked characteristics, rather than relying solely upon a predominant symptom and thereby, a recognisable disease. Some practitioners claim that sickness is a spiritual issue and because astrology is connected to cosmic forces, supernatural help can raise the patients spiritual level into a new state of well-being.
<br><br>

These concepts stem from ancient <i>Gnosticism</i> (literally meaning 'knowing'), which although is not a religion, has always threatened Christianity, at its core, as being its suppressed source of religious ideas. The central theme of Gnosticism is that the world and everything in it is purely evil and it is the duty of an enlightened person to break free from physical existence and ascend to the heavenly realm. Sickness, in this framework, is held to be caused by possession from evil demons, notably of a planetary nature. Nowadays, those demons are 'known' as diseases, and have medical names.

</div>

<br><br>
This idea is very different from that of Hermetic Philosophy which regards the Creation as Divine and Good (an idea which was partially absorbed into Christianity). Rather than blindly accepting one's lot, Hermetism concentrates on improving personal experiences in the current and real world by elevating spirituality towards the Divine in this life and not the next. Unfortunately, this idea was shunned by Christianity in favour of encompassing the Gnostic salvation after death.
<br><br>

Unluckily for Hermetism, it was hijacked early in its career by scribes sympathetic to Gnosticism, well before the Common Era (that is, BC or BCE). They wittingly modified the Hermetic texts to align with their own version of Gnosticism, especially that of the world being evil. The result was that some later texts, which are now claimed to be Hermetic, describe an aim of ascending to heaven through the 'planetary spheres', thereby escaping the evil. This was added to both Gnosticism and Hermetism by embracing kabbalistic concepts for an already existing audience.
<br><br>

The following quote about the Hermetic Logos and Nous, from Andre-Jean Festugiere (15.03.1898-13.08.1982), a French Christian friar, historian and philologist, who also translated the Corpus Hermeticum, is an example of how Hermetism can be confused with Gnosticism :
<br>

<div class="quo">
<i>
For even in man (the highest of the animals), the rational soul [personal logos} is still bound up with the body and dependent on matter. All the processes of the reason [logos] help one not one whit to make the ascent towards God. "Those who failed to hear the Divine Proclamation," says one of the Hermetic writers, "are those who possess the logos only, but have not received also the nous" that is, the faculty of mystical intuition;  . . . "these men know not for what purpose they have been made, and by whom they have been made". The entire spiritual quest therefore will consist in gathering together one's faculties within oneself, in ridding oneself of all images and all thoughts, in living in a state of pure passivity in
which one hopes, in the end, to find God. 
</i>
("Personal Religion Among The Greeks", p132)
</div>


And Elaine Pagels commented on the problem of "gnosis" or "knowing":
<div class="quo">
<i>
[Valentinus] believed, one could progress beyond faith to understanding, that is, to gnosis. This word is often translated into "knowledge", but the translation is somewhat misleading, since gnosis differs from intellectual knowledge (as in phrases like "they know mathematics"), which is characterized in Greek by the word eidein (from which we derive the English word idea).  
</i><hr><i>

English is unusual within its language group in having only one verb ("to know") to express different kinds of knowing. Modern European languages use one word to characterize intellectual knowledge and another for the knowledge of personal relationships: French, for example, distinguishes between <i>savoir</i> and <i>connaître</i>, Spanish between <i>saber</i> and <i>conocer</i>, Italian between <i>sapere</i> and <i>conoscere</i>, German between <i>wissen</i> and <i>kennen</i>. The Greek word gignosko, from which <i>gnosis</i> derives, refers to the knowledge of personal relationships (as in "We know Christ" or, in the words of the Delphic oracle, "Know thyself"). The term might better be translated as "insight", or "wisdom".
</i><hr><i>

One Gnostic teacher </i>[Hippolytus in "Refutation of All Heresies"]<i> encourages his students to seek gnosis within themselves:</i>
<div class="quo">
<i>
"Abandon the search for God, and creation, and similar things of that kind. Instead, take yourself as the starting place. Ask who it is within you who makes everything his own saying,
“my mind,” “my heart,” “my God.” Learn the sources of love, joy, hate, and desire. . . . If you carefully examine all these things, you will find [God] in yourself".

<h6>Medical Astrologers, The Iatromathematicians </h6>

Medical astrologers or <i>Iatromathematika</i> (from Greek <i>ἰατρική </i>, "medical" and <i>μαθηματικά</i>, "mathematics", therefore meaning those who astrologically calculate medical issues), were doctors, physicians or medical practitioners who applied the astrological correspondences to the parts of the human body, called <a href="#melothesia"><b><i>&raquo;"Melothesia"</i></b></a>, to investigate disease and discover remedies. Up until the advent of science, this was mainstream state of the art medicine. In English, Iatromathematika has its earliest usage in 1647, with the publication of <i>Christian Astrology</i> by the astrologer William Lilly. This work contains a lot of material about Medical Astrology, especially within the framework of Hermetic Philosophy. 
<br><br>

The medical astrologer employed a number of techniques starting with setting up charts for the client's time of birth and the time of the start of the sickness, called the <i>decumbiture</i>, usually when the patient first took to bed. The birth chart indicated the propensity for particular disorders, while the chart of the decumbiture encompassed the characteristics of the current ailments as well as possible treatments. Further charts could be implemented to determine transits, directions and progressions to anticipate the course of an illness.

There is a translation of a rare Technical Hermetic treatise entitled <b><i>&raquo;"Iatromathematics"</i></b> which describes the astrological procedures employed in the ancient world. It was originally in Greek and estimated to have been written around the 5th to 6th century CE.

Within the framework of regular allopathic <i>"Galenic/Hippocratic"</i> medicine inherited from ancient Greece and Rome, much attention was paid to the doctrine of the four humours of the human body. The word <i>humour</i> is a translation of Greek word <i>chymos</i>  (χυμός", literally meaning 'juice' or 'sap', metaphorically 'flavor'). It is unclear as to whether Hermetic Medical Astrologers were equally enthusiastic about the idea.

<img src="img/medicine/four_humours.jpg" alt="" class="modal-img" onclick="clk(this)" style="width:auto;">
The Four Humours 
</div>

It seems to have all started with Hippocrates (c.460–c.370 BCE), who in his work <i>On the Nature of Man</i>, describes the theory as follows: <i>The Human body contains blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile</i>. This was picked up by Galen (129-216 CE) who developed it further and this remained in use for many centuries (until the mid-1850s). According to the theory, any imbalance in the humours, leading to an excess of one or a deficiency in another, was taken to be the cause of sickness. 
<br><br>

The doctrine of the four humours led to a corresponding understanding of the four temperaments, also from Hippocrates, which affected human behaviour and personality. These types supposedly related to the outer appearance of a dominant or excessive humour. These in turn, being entrenched in astrology, were allied to the four elements and the four seasons:

<table style="padding:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
<tr><td><b>Humour&nbsp;</b></td><td><b>Temperament&nbsp;</b></td><td><b>Element&nbsp;</b></td><td><b>Qualities&nbsp;</b></td><td><b>Season&nbsp;</b></td></tr>

<tr><td>Phlegm&nbsp;</td><td>Phlegmatic&nbsp;</td><td>Water&nbsp;</td><td>cold&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;wet&nbsp;</td><td>Winter&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td>Blood&nbsp;</td><td>Sanguine&nbsp;</td><td>Air</td><td>hot&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;wet</td><td>Spring</td></tr>

<tr><td>Yellow&nbsp;Bile&nbsp;</td><td>Choleric&nbsp;</td><td>Fire</td><td>hot&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;dry</td><td>Summer</td></tr>

<tr><td>Black&nbsp;Bile&nbsp;</td><td>Melancholic&nbsp;</td><td>Earth&nbsp;</td><td>cold&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;dry&nbsp;</td><td>Autumn&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

All of this doesn't really relate to Hermetic philosophy. Indeed a number of Hermetic Astrologers at the time spoke out vehemently against the brutality of the treatments by mainstream allopathic medicine, in particular that of blood letting and purging. Paracelsus objected to excessive bloodletting as it disturbed the harmony of the system, and that blood could not be purified by lessening its quantity. The followers and devotees of Paracelsus, known as Paracelsians, in particular Jan Baptist van Helmont (12.01.1580–30.12.1644), were leading lights for those who chose the path of helping an ailing person, rather than increasing the suffering. 
<br><br>

It was Paracelsus who said in 1538 that: <br>
<div class="quo">
<i>"All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison." <br>
(Alle Dinge sind Gift, und nichts ist ohne Gift; allein die Dosis macht, dass ein Ding kein Gift ist.)</i>. 
</div>
<br>


<b>In Writing</b>
<br>

Paracelsus himself, avoided the word astrology in his numerous writings, perhaps to distance his work from the mainstream astrological medicine. Instead, when he wrote about influences from the heavens, he used the term <i>"Astral"</i> and urged Practitioners to know everything about <i>"Astronomey"</i> for timing of events. This is undestandable as he was more of an alchemist than an astrologer. To historians, this has brought about some misunderstanding regarding Hermetic texts which are only considered to be astrological if a chart was drawn and predictions were made. 
The Paracelsians, as the followers of Paracelsus, continued to publish his works, including translations into other languages such as Dutch, German, French, Latin and English, as well as penning new works attributed to Paracelsus, likely in the same manner as was done with Hermes Trismegistus.

<h6>Melothesia</h6>

The word <i>"Melothesia"</i> (Greek: μελοθεσία) stems from the ancient assignment of astrological symbolism to the human body. It was extant in Greco-Roman astral science and based on the doctrine of sympathy between the cosmos as macrocosm, mirroring the human as microcosm. Body parts were assigned to zodiacal signs and the internal organs mostly to planets.

Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practitioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
