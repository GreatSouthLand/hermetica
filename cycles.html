<b>Astronomy</b>
<br><br>
Astronomy is a science which concerns itself over using mathematical equations to determine the positions of the planets. Especially towards the end of the twentieth century with the advent of the computer, highly accurate predictions can be made.
<br>
<br>
This is rather ironic because it is the science making the prediction about that which has not happened, not Astrology. The planetary positions thus calculated enable Astrology to produce highly accurate results for more reliable interpretations.
<br>
<br>
To perform Cycle and Phase calculations for any particular point in time, it is therefore only necessary to have a program that will generate the necessary data. Traditionally the results of positional calculations were drawn up in tables called ephemerides. That is no longer necessary and the position of any two planets involved in a cycle may be quickly calculated and the relationship determined.

<h1 class="title"><span>Cycles and Phases in Hermetical Astrology</span></h1>

One of the most important facets of Hermetic Astrology, which has been maintained in all branches of astrology ever since, is that of the comparison of planetary positions relative to each other. This was inherited from the Babylonian Study of the Great Conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn which were based upon celestial observations and predictions about where those planets would be at any particular date.

<h5>The Zodiac and The Planets </h5>

The entire system of astrology is based upon the apparent path of the Sun as seen from Earth which completes a full circle of 360 degrees in one year. This circle passes through twelve constellations named collectively as the Zodiac from the Greek word z≈çon, meaning that which can move itself, such as animals. The signs of the zodiac are often taken to be the animals but it actually refers to the planets being able to move themselves. Each Sign of the Zodiac spans thirty degrees of the ecliptic. All the other planets travel close to the path of the ecliptic taking a greater or lesser time to circle the Earth. 
<br>
<br>

The start of the Zodiac is at the intersection of the ecliptic with another celestial plane which extends out from the plane of the earth's equator. Since the ecliptic and the celestial equator lie at an angle of about 23 degrees to each they only intersect at two points. One marks the start of the ecliptic at zero degrees of Aries, the first sign of the zodiac. The other is directly opposite, separated by 180 degrees at zero degrees of Libra.
<br>
<br>


<h2 class="title"><span>12 Signs, 12 Calendar Months, and 12 Clock Hours</span></h2>

The ecliptic being divided into twelve sections is no accident. This special number was inherited from both the Babylonian and Egyptian systems of time keeping and divination. The number twelve is easily divided by two, three, four and six and these divisions produce very important astrologically symbolic meaning. When these were inherited by the Arab world, a lot of the numerical symbolism was absorbed into and elaborated upon and used to form a system of number magic, part of which later turned into numerology at the start of the 20th century, previously known as arithmancy. This is rather useful, because the significance of particular numbers can be applied directly to many areas of astrological symbolism.

Divided into Two - As Above, So Below - Day and Night
<br>
<br>
The division of the ecliptic into two parts naturally has one half above the horizon, known as diurnal meaning of the daytime. The other half is nocturnal or of the night. Planets which are above the horizon are diurnal and portray more open and obvious characters. Conversely nocturnal planets below the horizon are in the dark and are regarded traditionally as weaker, negative and possible detrimental. Within the realms of phases and houses, the first six would be regarded as nocturnal and relate to private concerns. The last six are diurnal and relate to the impersonal, public or partner's concerns.
<br>
<br>
Divided into Three - An Element For Each
<br>
<br>
When the ecliptic is divided into three groups of four, each group is made up of the four different elements in the order of fire, earth, air, and water. The pattern repeats around the circle. The first group consists of fiery Aries, earthy Taurus, airy Gemini and watery Cancer and are the most personal. The next four, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio are concerned with close personal relationships, while Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces deal with public, impersonal or universal issues.
<br>
<br>
Divided into Four - Seasons of The Sun
<br>
<br>
The starting point of the ecliptic is at the Vernal Equinox which is the start of Spring in the northern hemisphere. The circle is then divided into the four seasons and correspondingly, the first three signs of the zodiac, Aries, Taurus and Gemini are regarded as Vernal Signs, Spring like. The next three, Cancer, Leo and Virgo are related to Summer, then Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius are autumnal, and finally Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are the signs of Winter.

The Ecliptic - Path of the Sun
<p>
Viewed from the Earth, the sun takes one calendar year to complete its cycle in a great circular path known as the ecliptic which is divided into the twelve signs of the zodiac. It's called the ecliptic because it is where eclipses occur.
</p>
</div> 


<h2 class="title"><span>All the Signs of The Zodiac</span></h2>

The circle of the Zodiac contains twelve signs, each with a different symbolic character. Even though for most astrological applications these are treated as discreet (separate) entities, the zodiac itself is continuous. In Hermetic Astrology, there is a natural transition from one sign to another. The last degrees of one sign are already showing the character of the next.
<br>
<br>
As well as that, throughout each sign, the degree ranges from zero to thirty which naturally can also affect the intensity and meaning of the sign's symbolism. In a low degree there is greater enthusiasm to become involved with the world through expressing the nature of whatever might be positioned at that degree, for instance, a planet. At a higher degree a person experiences the issues at hand, as having a much greater importance. 
<br>
<br>
Issues representing smaller degrees will have many more examples at hand in the world. Larger degrees are less often encountered but when they are, the gravity of the situation calls for a different strategy for dealing with them. It is important to note that someone who experiences various issues of low degrees might night necessarily perceive those of larger degrees. These people simpler pass over the topic as if were not there. Conversely the person worried about the larger picture could easily see another person's low degree issues, no matter how frequent, as being unimportant.
<br>
<br>
The whole circle of the Zodiac can be viewed in a similar way to that of the "Fool's Journey" through the Major Arcana of the Tarot. In our case, the fool starts out at Aries, keen and unaware of pitfalls or dangers. Travelling through each of the twelve signs, the native acquires some things in life whether they be material stuff or experiences from interacting with the world. The outcome is to end up at the last sign, Pisces, which is concerned about everything in the world, cosmos or universe, exoterically and esoterically. This can escalate to the ultimate need of starting over again with that which has been learnt and become a new type of fool.
<br>
<br>
The passage of the planets through the signs is never ending and at birth we step into this flow not knowing what it is, where it is going or especially from where it came. Hermetic Astrology can start to reveal all this information. By applying the symbolism of the signs of the zodiac to various other astrological cycles we can soon discover that the twelve phases of any cycle maintain the same symbolic nature as that of the zodiacal signs.
<br>
<br>

So how would the symbolism of the first sign, Aries, turn into that of Taurus, the second sign? Some tables are presented here in order to elaborate.
<br>
<br>

<h2 class="title"><span>Symbols of the Zodiac - The Signs and Their Meaning</span></h2>

The Ruler of a sign is the planet with the most symbolism in common with it.
<br>
<i>+ve means expressive / manipulative, <br>
-ve means receptive / creative</i>
<br>
<br>
The Modes reveal the dynamic flow of energy within sections of a cycle, whereby 
Cardinal relates to growing and bringing on something new, Fixed is a sustaining mode holding onto something already in the existence and Mutable means transforming and facilitation or variation in something.<br>
<br>
The Element of a Sign reveals the basic symbolic material. Fire - is impulsive, intentional and eager, Air - is inventive, mentally-active and volatile, Water - is  emotional, sensitive, changeable, creative and Earth - is practical, realistic, materialistic, stable. <br>
<br>

</div>
At the start of Aries in traditional and modern astrology, the symbolism is fairly clear and our analogy of the fool about to set out on a journey works quite well; naive and keen to make a personal statement. This doesn't mean being the center of attention, that is more like Leo in which case an audience is needed. The Aries style is more centered and focused and if anything, revels in contrasting to that which is around by standing out alone. Also at the lower degrees, Aries will show aptitude for the symbols and issues of the sign before. This could possibly make for showing off esoteric knowledge and skills normally belonging in the realm of Pisces. Many astrologers fall into this category. So does Johann Sebastian Bach for example, who with his Aries Sun was an expert at religious music. Towards the end of Aries there is such an exaggerated need for self-expression that it will soon become obvious that something is lacking. That "something" is the symbol of the second sign of the zodiac, Taurus and works just as well as the symbolism for the second phase of any cycle.

</div>
Traditionally Taurus relates to possessions which the native has or gets. This could be personal, such as bodily attributes, talents or behaviour, as well as that which could be acquired from the world such as personal property or achievement. Being ruled by Venus, there is a keen affinity to substantial things and matters, as well as innate sense for what can be used where. The Earth element combined with the fixed mode makes for a stability not seen elsewhere. Here we can find reliablity and can trust that once something is started, it will reach an end. The early degrees might express themselves through artistic appreciation or endeavours, keen business acumen or simply a life of indulgence, As the degrees progress the understanding of the material world increases to the point of making something out of it. Here comes creativity, ingenuity and often talent combined with hard work to bring something wonderful into the world. In the highest degrees, communication of ideas as symbolised by the third sign, Gemini, are in dire demand.

</div>
Gemini is a talkative sign. The same goes for Phase Three. That's probably why it is allocated to twins, providing a ready and eager conversational partner, even if simply to oneself. With an ever active mind, and keen to say what's on it, ideas come easily as if plucked out of the air, which is its astrological element. The mutability of this sign adds a restlessness as each thought moves on to the next intriguiging topic of interest. Being ruled by the silver tongued Mercury, messenger to the Gods, makes for fast and smooth transitions which are barely noticeable. Some have remarked that this is somewhat akin to birdlike behaviour flitting from one source of nectar to the next. Being Mercurial by nature can also be a little slippery when it comes down to establishing a firm opinion or attitude. Generally in such cases, conviction can still be found elsewhere in a chart and when it is, it will be spoken about, liberally. At the early degrees of this sign or phase, the leftover issues from the themes of the second sign or phase, that is of 'things', are usually spoken of in great detail. The larger degrees are not too comfortable with matters of great gravity but when at hand will normally be expressed as impersonal issues of dire concern. It urges for the stabilty to be found in the next sign or phase, a new base, a place to call home.

The Planets - Moving Celestial Bodies
<p>
The word planet is derived from an ancient Greek word planƒìtƒìs (œÄŒªŒ±ŒΩŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ), meaning wanderer. All seven of the planets, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn can be observed to move through the zodiac, not far from the ecliptic. 
</p>
</div>
<br>



<h5>Revolution - The Sidereal Period</h5>

The time taken by each planetary body to complete one revolution by returning to any specified point on the ecliptic is known as its Sidereal Period, literally meaning its time to travel through the starry constellations. The Moon, Mercury and Venus, known as the inner planets, are faster than the sun and therefore they take less than one year. The outer planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn take longer than a year.
<br>

<p>Illustration from Johannes Kepler's description of a series of Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions, showing how consecutive conjunctions are mostly in the next triplicity (sign of the same element, here water) and then almost returning to the same degree as earlier, albeit a little further advanced.
</p>
</div>

<h5>Cycles and Phases</h5>

Sometimes planets can be extremely close to each other on the ecliptic and when this happens it is called a conjunction. In modern astrology, it is known as an aspect of conjunction and there are many other aspects such as an opposition, meaning most distant from each other. In ancient times though, the Hermetic system used a twelfth of the ecliptic to describe the separation. Each twelfth of the 360 degrees of the ecliptic is therefore 30 degrees, which is also the size of each zodiacal sign.
<br>
<br>
Older texts use the word phase (phasein in Greek) to denote how many 30 degree sections apart the planets are to be found in an astrological configuration drawn up as a chart. More modern translations and adaptations prefer sometimes to call them houses but that term has many different meanings. <br>
<br>
So, say for instance, Jupiter and Saturn happen to be separated by 100 degrees along the ecliptic, and Jupiter is ahead of Saturn, the configuration would be described as Jupiter in Saturn's fourth house or phase. This type of reckoning is distinctly part of Mesopotamian and Babylonian celestial divination of the Chaldean period, having been absorbed at the foundation of hermetic astrology.
<br>
<br>
In that ancient world, the study of these cycles, especially of Jupiter and Saturn, was employed to predict the fates and affairs of nations and their leaders. It was the Greek adaptation that turned it into the Astrology we know today. That also made way for all of the planets to be utilised in such a manner. Bearing all this in mind, it was the combined Greek and Egyptian contribution that systematised the celestial influences coming from the zodiac. The twelve signs impart twelve distinct characters upon the planets which pass through them.

The Phases of the Moon
<p>
Everyone is familiar with how the moon makes phases to the sun whereby the cycle is traditionally divided into four or eight parts. In phase astrology we use the Hermetic division of twelve. At new moon, the sun and moon are in the same degree of the ecliptic and are said to be in conjunction and at the start of phase one. At full moon, the moon has already passed through the first six phases and is then in opposition to the sun and entering phase seven.

<h5>Planetary Symbolism</h5>

Each of the seven planets has its own symbolism. Here are some very brief examples. Knowing this basic information helps makes more sense when dealing with two together forming a phase within a cycle.

<h2 class="title"><span>All the Cycles</span></h2>

With lunar phases, such as at new or full moon, they are always with respect to the position of the sun as a reference point. The moon makes the phase to the sun. At full moon, this is at the start of phase seven, having already passed through the previous six phases since new moon. 

The same basic principle applies to any two planets, whereby the faster one makes a phase to the slower one. For instance, when considering the cycle of Jupiter and Saturn, Jupiter would be making a phase to Saturn, the slower planet. 


<h5> Dynamic Rather Than Static</h5>

Astrological Charts are drawn up in a manner to intentionally freeze a moment in time to discover the character of that moment. This has the effect of more or less overlooking that which came before and that which is about to happen. 

The most important difference with phase astrology is that the movements of the planets are seen as dynamic. There is a cycle going on, and we glimpse at a moment of that cycle. This is more in keeping with the ancient Egyptian attitude of a stream of thought and consideration. In essence, it is Hermetic.

<h5>Houses</h5>

Of course, any planet moving through the zodiac, can make a phase to any chosen point on the ecliptic. This principle is employed over and again in various astrological techniques. The most obvious would be that of the modern system of house division. 

Astrological houses use a fixed reference point on the ecliptic called the Ascendant. It is simply the point rising on the eastern geographical horizon at the time of an event. Therefore when speaking of a planet in the fourth house, it could also be described as that planet being in phase four to the Ascendant. 
<br>
<br>




<h1 class="title"><span>All the Cycles and Phases in Hermetical Astrology</span></h1>

Having a total of seven planets, there are altogether twenty-one possible cycles. These are listed in the table shown on the right. Each of these cycles has a particular meaning and the two planets involved in each cycle, and their signs, all have a particular character. So all twenty-one cycles have their meaning as well. The Jupiter-Saturn Cycle, for instance, starting at what was known as the Great Conjunction, was regarded as being an event so large that the futures of nations and rulers were at stake. It describes the greatest which is possible through benefic Jupiter and the boundary of conflict and restriction brought about by malefic Saturn. 
<br>
<br>

Decades of observation of the phases produced within all the cycles has revealed patterns and tendencies. The major issues produced by the planets in a cycle lie in the difficulty of seeing relevant examples or role models to help become and maintain that which is possible. As a fallback, the ease with which the issues of the previous phase are handled more often than not tempts the native into doing those things in preference to the more difficult ones at hand.
<br><br>

As an example, when social issues occurring in phase eleven seem to be indomitable, the person facing such difficulties can more readily escape into public affairs, the realm of phase ten. Here will be greater success and acclaim, such that everything appears to be as it should, as if destined to be that way. Yet those phase eleven issues will get in the way the longer they are pushed aside.

<b>One's Place in the World</b>
<br><br>
The Jupiter-Saturn cycle is not only of great historical importance, it is also the most significant for events or individuals. Jupiter strives to make its mark on the planet while Saturn seems to go out of its way to ensure that won't happen. Because these are the largest planets, the major issues here are the difficulty of becoming or growing into that which should be, and also  structuring and maintaining that which was possible. The tendency to operate within the realm of the previous phase is even greater than with the other cycles.

It's all about me.<br>
Cardinal, fiery and ruled by the brighter side of Mars, this is an energetic and enthusiastic phase. Usually single minded, there is a strong tendency to make a name for oneself. That is far more important than to what that name might be attached but the achievement will also be well remembered like a Ford car or a Dylan song. Important, most of all, was to establish something new, the start of that which was not there before. Whether it be Isaac Newton's first law of motion, Henry Ford's first mass produced car, Pablo Picasso's abstract art, or Jack Kerouac's Stream of consciousness (very Hermetic), there is no doubt these people are cultural pioneers. Like all phases, the source material lies in the realm of the previous phase, in this case Phase Twelve, so it should come as no surprise that Isaac Newton was a keen alchemist. John Lennon and Paul McCartney managed to create something new out of their vast musical knowledge and skills of what their predecessors had already achieved. Immanuel Kant managed to establish modern philosophy, yet only because of his particularly rational treatment of an  immense knowledge of what had been before.

There's More to Life Than This<br>
Wherever this phase is found there will be an enrichment created by a true artist at work. Perhaps a flourish, or some depth or drama, but there will surely be that something extra to make the experience more worth while. Most people who have heard the masterpieces of J. S. Bach will agree that he managed to turn music into a religious experience. The lavish brush strokes and use of colours in a Rembrandt painting are larger than life, leaving lasting impressions. The gripped tone and turn in the words of Kafka or Nietzsche have resonated with generations of readers. One can be sure the same be said of George Harrison's unexpected classics. Speaking of classics, where would the world be without Grimm's Fairy Tales, the product of an untiring effort from Jacob Grimm and his brother Wilhelm? When Curly Howard joined his brothers in The Three Stooges his elaborate improvisations were the very nature of their success. Archie Leach in a similar fashion reinvented himself as the actor Cary Grant, equally offstage as on, to become the Hollywood Icon for which he was famous.

Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practitioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
