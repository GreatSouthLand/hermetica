<b>Astronomy</b>
<br><br>
Astronomy is a science which concerns itself over using mathematical equations to determine the positions of the planets. Especially towards the end of the twentieth century with the advent of the computer, highly accurate predictions can be made.
<br>
<br>
This is rather ironic because it is the science making the prediction about that which has not happened, not Astrology. The planetary positions thus calculated enable Astrology to produce highly accurate results for more reliable interpretations.
<br>
<br>
To perform Cycle and Phase calculations for any particular point in time, it is therefore only necessary to have a program that will generate the necessary data. Traditionally the results of positional calculations were drawn up in tables called ephemerides. That is no longer necessary and the position of any two planets involved in a cycle may be quickly calculated and the relationship determined.

<h1 class="title">Cycles and Phases in Hermetical Astrology</h1>

One of the most important facets of Hermetic Astrology, which has been maintained in all branches of astrology ever since, is that of the comparison of planetary positions relative to each other. This was inherited from the Babylonian Study of the Great Conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn which were based upon celestial observations and predictions about where those planets would be at any particular date.

<h6>The Zodiac and The Planets </h6>

The entire system of astrology is based upon the apparent path of the Sun as seen from Earth which completes a full circle of 360 degrees in one year. This circle passes through twelve constellations named collectively as the Zodiac from the Greek word z≈çon, meaning that which can move itself, such as animals. The signs of the zodiac are often taken to be the animals but it actually refers to the planets being able to move themselves. Each Sign of the Zodiac spans thirty degrees of the ecliptic. All the other planets travel close to the path of the ecliptic taking a greater or lesser time to circle the Earth. 
<br>
<br>

The start of the Zodiac is at the intersection of the ecliptic with another celestial plane which extends out from the plane of the earth's equator. Since the ecliptic and the celestial equator lie at an angle of about 23 degrees to each they only intersect at two points. One marks the start of the ecliptic at zero degrees of Aries, the first sign of the zodiac. The other is directly opposite, separated by 180 degrees at zero degrees of Libra.
<br>
<br>


<h2 class="title">12 Signs, 12 Calendar Months, and 12 Clock Hours</h2>


The ecliptic being divided into twelve sections is no accident. This special number was inherited from both the Babylonian and Egyptian systems of time keeping and divination. For all cultures, time keeping has always been of paramount importance and was derived from the phenomena occurring in the heavens. The most obvious of such would be the Sun's movement throughout the year as well as the Moon throughout each month. For some, such as the ancient Egyptians, the rising and falling of the constellations of fixed stars, both daily and yearly, were fundamental. 

<div class="rboxc" style="clear:right; width:30%; margin:20px 0px 0px 20px;">
<img src="img/cycles/astro_clock.jpg" alt="source: wikipedia" class="modal-img" onclick="clk(this)">
<p>Astronomical Clock with Signs of the Zodiac</p>
</div>

<br>
<br>
 
Time-reckoning based upon the apparent movement of the Sun through its yearly cycle around the earth is called a solar calendar. Although not part of calendar time, the daily rising and setting of the Sun was equally important, forming the basis of clock-time. Some early calendars were based upon the Moon and its phases and are now referred to as lunar calendars. The modern Islamic calendar is an example of a lunar calendar. The most obvious event happening for the Moon naturally is the full moon when the sun is directly opposite the Moon and shines fully over its face. When the Sun and Moon are near each other on the ecliptic, a New Moon occurs and since the light reflected by the Moon is at a minimum, its face is not visible. 
<br>
<br>
Every new or full moon is known as a syzygy, an ancient Greek term meaning yoked together. The time between two syzygies is called a lunation which takes about 29.5 days. Therefore there are always twelve complete lunations each and every year. At the time when the solar and lunar calendar systems were merged into lunisolar calendars, such as used in the modern western world, the result was a year of twelve months and correspondingly twelve astrological signs aligned to those months. 
In 731BC, Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, decided to line the calendar up with the phases of the moon.
<br>
<br>
The ancient time reckoners were keen mathematicians and quickly noticed that the number twelve is easily divided by two, three, four and six and these divisions produce very important astrologically symbolic meaning. When these were inherited by the Arab world, a lot of the numerical symbolism was absorbed into and elaborated upon and used to form a system of number magic, part of which later turned into numerology, at the start of the 20th century, previously known as arithmancy. This is rather useful, because the significance of particular numbers can be applied directly to many areas of astrological symbolism.

<h6>Divided into Two - As Above, So Below - Day and Night</h6>

The division of the ecliptic into two parts naturally has one half above the horizon, known as diurnal meaning of the daytime. The other half is nocturnal or of the night. Planets which are above the horizon are diurnal and portray more open and obvious characters. Conversely nocturnal planets below the horizon are in the dark and are regarded traditionally as weaker, negative and possible detrimental. Within the realms of phases and houses, the first six would be regarded as nocturnal and relate to private concerns. The last six are diurnal and relate to the impersonal, public or partner's concerns.
<br>
<br>

<h6>Divided into Three - An Element For Each</h6>

When the ecliptic is divided into three groups of four, each group is made up of the four different elements in the order of fire, earth, air, and water. The pattern repeats around the circle. The first group consists of fiery Aries, earthy Taurus, airy Gemini and watery Cancer and are the most personal. The next four, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio are concerned with close personal relationships, while Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces deal with public, impersonal or universal issues.
<br>
<br>

<h6>Divided into Four - Seasons of The Sun</h6>

The starting point of the ecliptic is at the Vernal Equinox which is the start of Spring in the northern hemisphere. The circle is then divided into the four seasons and correspondingly, the first three signs of the zodiac, Aries, Taurus and Gemini are regarded as Vernal Signs, Spring like. The next three, Cancer, Leo and Virgo are related to Summer, then Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius are autumnal, and finally Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are the signs of Winter.

The Ecliptic - Path of the Sun
<p>
Viewed from the Earth, the sun takes one calendar year to complete its cycle in a great circular path known as the ecliptic which is divided into the twelve signs of the zodiac. It's called the ecliptic because it is where eclipses occur.
</p>
</div> 


<h2 class="title">All the Signs of The Zodiac</h2>


The circle of the Zodiac contains twelve signs, each with a different symbolic character. Even though for most astrological applications these are treated as discreet (separate) entities, the zodiac itself is continuous. In Hermetic Astrology, there is a natural transition from one sign to another. The last degrees of one sign are already showing the character of the next.
<br>
<br>
As well as that, throughout each sign, the degree ranges from zero to thirty which naturally can also affect the intensity and meaning of the sign's symbolism. In a low degree there is greater enthusiasm to become involved with the world through expressing the nature of whatever might be positioned at that degree, for instance, a planet. At a higher degree a person experiences the issues at hand, as having a much greater importance. 
<br>
<br>
Issues representing smaller degrees will have many more examples at hand in the world. Larger degrees are less often encountered but when they are, the gravity of the situation calls for a different strategy for dealing with them. It is important to note that someone who experiences various issues of low degrees might not necessarily perceive those of larger degrees. These people simpler pass over the topic as if were not there. Conversely the person worried about the larger picture could easily see another person's low degree issues, no matter how frequent, as being unimportant.
<br>
<br>
The whole circle of the Zodiac can be viewed in a similar way to that of the "Fool's Journey" through the Major Arcana of the Tarot. In our case, the fool starts out at Aries, keen and unaware of pitfalls or dangers. Travelling through each of the twelve signs, the native acquires some things in life whether they be material stuff or experiences from interacting with the world. The outcome is to end up at the last sign, Pisces, which is concerned about everything in the world, cosmos or universe, exoterically and esoterically. This can escalate to the ultimate need of starting over again with that which has been learnt and become a new type of fool.
<br>
<br>
The passage of the planets through the signs is never ending and at birth we step into this flow not knowing what it is, where it is going or especially from where it came. Hermetic Astrology can start to reveal all this information. By applying the symbolism of the signs of the zodiac to various other astrological cycles we can soon discover that the twelve phases of any cycle maintain the same symbolic nature as that of the zodiacal signs.
<br>
<br>

So how would the symbolism of the first sign, Aries, turn into that of Taurus, the second sign? Some tables are presented here in order to elaborate.
<br>
<br>


<h2 class="title">Symbols of the Zodiac<br>
The Signs and Their Meaning</h2>


The Ruler of a sign is the planet with the most symbolism in common with it.
<br>
<i>+ve means expressive / manipulative, <br>
-ve means receptive / creative</i>
<br>
<br>
The Modes reveal the dynamic flow of energy within sections of a cycle, whereby 
Cardinal relates to growing and bringing on something new, Fixed is a sustaining mode holding onto something already in the existence and Mutable means transforming and facilitation or variation in something.<br>
<br>
The Element of a Sign reveals the basic symbolic material. Fire - is impulsive, intentional and eager, Air - is inventive, mentally-active and volatile, Water - is  emotional, sensitive, changeable, creative and Earth - is practical, realistic, materialistic, stable. <br>
<br>

</div>
At the start of Aries in traditional and modern astrology, the symbolism is fairly clear and our analogy of the fool about to set out on a journey works quite well; naive and keen to make a personal statement. This doesn't mean being the center of attention, that is more like Leo in which case an audience is needed. The Aries style is more centered and focused and if anything, revels in contrasting to that which is around by standing out alone. Also at the lower degrees, Aries will show aptitude for the symbols and issues of the sign before. This could possibly make for showing off esoteric knowledge and skills normally belonging in the realm of Pisces. Many astrologers fall into this category. So does Johann Sebastian Bach for example, who with his Aries Sun was an expert at religious music. Towards the end of Aries there is such an exaggerated need for self-expression that it will soon become obvious that something is lacking. That "something" is the symbol of the second sign of the zodiac, Taurus and works just as well as the symbolism for the second phase of any cycle.

</div>
Traditionally Taurus relates to possessions which the native has or gets. This could be personal, such as bodily attributes, talents or behaviour, as well as that which could be acquired from the world such as personal property or achievement. Being ruled by Venus, there is a keen affinity to substantial things and matters, as well as innate sense for what can be used where. The Earth element combined with the fixed mode makes for a stability not seen elsewhere. Here we can find reliability and can trust that once something is started, it will reach an end. The early degrees might express themselves through artistic appreciation or endeavours, keen business acumen or simply a life of indulgence, As the degrees progress the understanding of the material world increases to the point of making something out of it. Here comes creativity, ingenuity and often talent combined with hard work to bring something wonderful into the world. In the highest degrees, communication of ideas as symbolised by the third sign, Gemini, are in dire demand.

</div>
Gemini is a talkative sign. The same goes for Phase Three. That's probably why it is allocated to twins, providing a ready and eager conversational partner, even if simply to oneself. With an ever active mind, and keen to say what's on it, ideas come easily as if plucked out of the air, which is its astrological element. The mutability of this sign adds a restlessness as each thought moves on to the next intriguing topic of interest. Being ruled by the silver tongued Mercury, messenger to the Gods, makes for fast and smooth transitions which are barely noticeable. Some have remarked that this is somewhat akin to birdlike behaviour flitting from one source of nectar to the next. Being Mercurial by nature can also be a little slippery when it comes down to establishing a firm opinion or attitude. Generally in such cases, conviction can still be found elsewhere in a chart and when it is, it will be spoken about, liberally. At the early degrees of this sign or phase, the leftover issues from the themes of the second sign or phase, that is of 'things', are usually spoken of in great detail. The larger degrees are not too comfortable with matters of great gravity but when at hand will normally be expressed as impersonal issues of dire concern. It urges for the stability to be found in the next sign or phase, a new base, a place to call home.

</div>
Following after the last nervous degrees of the third chord of astrological symbolism, our journey seeks solace and protection from the world. This fourth chord is related to the Moon ruled Cancer and seeks a home in which to settle to collect and recollect the thoughts and impressions of the world,  reflecting over what has happened and make plans for the future. The start of Cancer and 4th phase represent the lowest point below the horizon and setting out from there means acquiring common knowledge and cultural values. These are normally learnt in the nest, so to speak, and carried with us wherever life takes us. In fact, where someone with phase four is to be found will also be someone making oneself at home. At the final degrees, an urgency will arise to overcome this and get out and about, meet people and have a life of one"s own as is the case for the Leonine fifth chord.

</div>
Being ruled by the Sun, both Leo and Phase five both shine best when being at the center of attention. Leo is a natural at this sort of thing usually having a warm character that attracts an audience and a regal demeanour that warrants it. Phase five on the other hand has a tendency to move into the correct circles where this will happen, as if naturally. Yet it is never unjustified, as a lot of energy gets poured into deserving this acknowledgement. At the later degrees this can easily be overdone leading to health problems, the issue of the next section of the circle.

</div>
The sixth vibration of the wheel of the zodiac is that of Virgo and Phase Six. Ruled by Mercury in its receptive and creative mode often leads to concern over details to the point of worry. Yet this is just as often dealt with as it comes, through finding and developing methods to apply mindful techniques. This is the last segment of the circle below the horizon and as such is the last, and probably the largest of the personal concerns. It encompasses health issues and all things to do with personal exchange in the world. The final degrees are heading out into where others are encountered and that exchange will eventually require dealing with other people.

</div>
This is the classic house of relationships. Both Libra and Phase Seven are ruled by Venus in its positive, outgoing mode. Of course, encounters with other people rely greatly on personal skills, so some can also end up as confrontations. Being symbolised by the scales, as well as being ruled by Venus, can lead to evaluations of others and weighing -up of situations to the point of great attraction or rejection. In the highest degrees, tensions can build and the juices will flow.

</div>
Even though there are 12 signs and phases, the last four are ruled only by the larger, outer planets, Jupiter and Saturn, which present most people with issues that are so large and impersonal, that their astrological foray into the world ends with the eighth chord, Scorpio or Phase Eight. To top that off it's ruled by the negative side of Mars,the malefic bringer of war. That is why it is for most,  connected to death, mystery, sex, darkness, violence and finality. Yet it is also the realm of revealing that which is not normally seen. This of course in the later degrees brings about the urgency and necessity for going beyond the ordinary into the realm of the ninth chord.

</div>
Sagittarius, the Archer, has an aim in life and that is to go beyond normality and explore that which may be beyond. Jupiter as ruler ensures unlimited endurance and success whether it be intellectual, cultural, athletic, philosophical or any other pursuit regarded as unnecessary but highly culturally rewarding. Phase nine has the added advantage of having a knack if overcoming the hurdles of the previous phase by turning those issues into skills, effectively filling the quiver full of arrows. In the later degrees, there are dangers of overdoing it and needed some restraint and circumspection, the issues of the next chord.

The Planets - Moving Celestial Bodies
<p>
The word planet is derived from an ancient Greek word planƒìtƒìs (œÄŒªŒ±ŒΩŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ), meaning wanderer. All seven of the planets, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn can be observed to move through the zodiac, not far from the ecliptic.

<h2 class="title">The Planets and Their Meaning</h2>


While the zodiacal signs are actually fixed stars within the firmament of the sky, the planets are forever moving through them. Just like the signs, the planets have important symbolic meaning. In Hermetic Astrology, the planets are handled in what is called the Chaldean Order, which organises them in ascending order according to how long they appear to encircle the Earth. The fastest is the Moon and starts the list.

The term Chaldean refers to the Hellenistic Hermetic Astrology practised in the region previously known as Babylonian. Until modern times, astrologers practising that flavour of astrology were often simply called Chaldeans. One of those, named Vettius Valens, outlines how the ancients connected the planets to the signs. Each of the seven planets has its own symbolism. Here are some very brief examples. Knowing this basic information helps makes more sense when dealing with two together forming a phase within a cycle.<br>

<h4><b><span>a</span>&nbsp;Moon</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: emotion, sensitivity, reflection<br>
Ruler of Cancer<br>
<hr class="blank">
The Moon is like a deep pool of feelings, reflections, memories and unformed thoughts. Being related to everyday speaking and listening, it buffers both incoming and outgoing information so smoothly and automatically that there is no need for conscious monitoring. This can be good in some ways but often things are said without wanting, or knowing, to have said them. An important consideration regarding the Moon is how close it is to the Earth at the time of an event (determined by calculation), as this can have quite an impact on its expression. The closer the Moon is to the Earth, the faster is its apparent motion, which in turn produces significantly faster lunar reactions and responses.

<h4><b><span>b</span>&nbsp;Mercury</b></h4>
Some Keywords: thought, adaptability, speed<br>
Ruler of Gemini and Virgo<br>
<hr class="blank">
Mercury is the ancient Roman name afopted for the Greek god Hermes, whose name is still used in Greece for this planet. The symbols for these two gods are not identical but similar enough to determine something meaningful. First and foremost, Mercury is associated with communication, language, thought and ideas, but unlike the Moon, is quite conscious and intentional. When retrograde, expression of communication can be reversed often leading to greater skill at writing, often accompanied by starting at the end.

<h4><b><span>c</span>&nbsp;Venus</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: attraction, desire, harmony<br>
Ruler of Taurus and Libra<br>
<hr class="blank">
As ruler of the earthy, receptive and creative Taurus, Venus is the sensual planet, able to appreciate physical characteristics of things in the world. As the ruler of the airy and mindful Libra, Venus is also able to grasp aesthetics and balance harmony, so all round is constantly evaluating the worth and worthiness of whatever is encountered. When Venus is retrograde, it reverses its approach to matters at hand such that where it would normally be receptive, it becomes expressive. Someone in this situation usually has a deep seated feeling of being unappreciated despite receiving more than the usual amount of admiration.

<h4><b><span>d</span>&nbsp;Sun</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: energy, generosity, drive<br>
Ruler of Leo<br>
<hr class="blank">
The Sun is the eternal logos which brightens everything. It is the true self, the core purpose and undeviating importance in life. As ruler of Leo it revels in being at the center of attention to warm an appreciative audience. The Sun also describes one's energy source and level as well as enthusiasm, interest, optimism and spirit. Of course, the Sun can't have any affliction or negativity of its own but sometimes getting that glowing going can be problematic. What helps the most in such cases is to look at the Sun's relationships to other planets to gain greater access to potentials at hand. The key to the Sun's energy is to get it to flow.

<h4><b><span>e</span>&nbsp;Mars</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: impulse, movement, assertion<br>
Ruler of Aries and Scorpio<br>
<hr class="blank">
Mars is the planet of action. In a chart it shows where activities will have their greatest effect. Looking at its relationships to other planets can reveal easiness or difficulty when undertaking something, for instance, when in combination with the Sun, where one's energy can flow into one's actions. When Mars is retrograde, a rather unique situation arises. There is a tendency to overcompensate for the feeling of underachieving. The result is to apply so much more force that there can be a possibility of endangering oneself.

<h4><b><span>f</span>&nbsp;Jupiter</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: expansion, capability, fortune<br>
Ruler of Sagittarius and Pisces<br>
<hr class="blank">
This is the planet of largesse and extravagance, If something is being done and Jupiter is involved, then it often ends up being larger than life. Jupiter as ruler of Sagittarius, always tends to aim for more. Whether it be something sporty or educational, or with its connection to Pisces, religious or mystical, Jupiter will seek out the most of it. When Jupiter is retrograde, there could be an accompanying feeling of caution in whatever is undertaken, in an effort to ensure there is no wasting of time or resources.

<h4><b><span>g</span>&nbsp;Saturn</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: limits, strength, definition<br>
Ruler of Capricorn and Aquarius<br>
<hr class="blank">
Even though Saturn is regarded as a malefic planet, meaning injurious or restrictive, getting to understand what Saturn actually does, can help overcome potential pitfalls or drawbacks. First and foremost is that Saturn relates to form. Attempting to form something into that which it can't be could be seen as either a frustrating experience or a safeguard to prevent deviation from that which would be more appropriate. When Saturn is retrograde, boundaries are not so well defined or perceived which could lead to doing something, or being somewhere, detrimental.

<h6>Planetary Rulers of the Signs</h6>

Each of the twelve signs is associated with a ruling planet, known appropriately as its ruler. Once again this is not arbitrary and the ancients thought out a scheme of allocation. Since the Sun and Moon, known together as the luminaries or the lights, are extremely important in any chart the rulerships start with them. The sign with most affinity to the Sun is Leo and that for the Moon is Cancer. This effectively divides the signs into two groups sometimes referred to as the solar and lunar sections. Around the circle the polarities change from positive (outgoing, expressive) to negative (receptive, creative).

<h6>Planetary Rulers of the Weekdays</h6>

<p>The Days of the Week<br>and Their Rulers</p>
</div>

That there are seven days to the week and seven planets is no coincidence. The planets are associated using a particular pattern, once again based on the Hermetic Chaldean Order. As is seen in the diagram to the left, that order, starting with  the Moon at the top, runs clockwise through the Chaldean Order, finishing with Saturn. Starting at the Moon and Monday, its namesake, and following the arrows, the weekdays are encountered in the correctly known order.
<br>
<br>
Whether or not it was the earliest, a seven day week was decreed by King Sargon I of Akkad, sometime around 2300 BCE. Sargon managed to form the very first known empire in Mesopotamia, known as the Akkadian Empire, uniting Sumerian and Akkadian speaking peoples.
<br>
<br>
The ancient mathematicians who observed the celestial objects for their timekeeping were also aware of the fact that a lunation takes 28 days and that four weeks of seven days each fit neatly into the scheme of things. Those four weeks align nicely with the four well known phases of the Moon, namly new, first quarter, full and last quarter. 


<hr class="blank h20">


<h6>Planetary Hours</h6>

When the rulers of the weekdays were allocated, something else was noticed by the ancients. When considering planetary hours, the daytime from sunrise to sunset is divided into twelve equal segments. The night time from sunset to the next sunrise. is also divided by twelve. When the daylight is longer than the darkness, the day hours will be longer than regular clock hours, the night hours being shorter,
<br>
<br>
The day begins at sunrise, as was the case in ancient times and still is for some modern time keeping, a day's ruling planet is also allocated to the first hour of the new day. The subsequent 24 hours are then ruled by the planets in a reversed Chaldean Order, from Saturn to Moon. The 25th hour just happens to be the same planet as the ruler of the next day.

As an example, take any Saturday, with its ruler as Saturn. Starting at sunrise, the first hour is also ruled by Saturn. The next by Jupiter, then by Mars and so forth. The 25th hour, which is the first hour of the next day, Sunday, will happen to be ruled by the Sun, automatically.

In the example of a planetary hour clock shown on the left, the grey area represents night time, the white part day time. The black line running through the middle of day and night runs from the nadir, lowest point of the sun, at mid-night, to the zenith, the highest point of the Sun, at mid-day. The red line is like a clock hand which says that the current hour is ruled by the Sun. 
<br>
<br>
This particular clock starts at the lowest point marked as 0 for midnight. The upper left edge of the grey area shows the end of the previous night and therefore the sunrise of the current day, just before 6 o'clock, with Saturn ruling the first hour, so it is a Saturday. The day continues until the last planetary hour, ruled by Venus, up to just past 9 o'oclock in the evening. The clock display ends at the 0, for midnight of this particular day.

<h6>You Can Do Magic</h6>

For millennia, all of these rulerships have been employed in other branches of the Hermetic Arts, such as Magic (manipulation of the physical world), Medicine (treatment with substances), Theurgy (commanding of spirits) or Alchemy (transformation of matter or spirit). The rulerships are mainly used to time events in the practice of these arts in order to utilise desirable planetary energies on available hours and days and so on.
<br><br>
When it comes to the older Hermetic versions of these arts, there are  philosophical concepts underlying the practice which involve Planetary Daimons. A Daimon is a sort of half-god, partly of the created world, partly of the divine world. The ancient Greek word Daimon (Œ¥Œ±ŒØŒºœâŒΩ), refers to lesser divinities or spirits, and is used in various contexts within Hermetic Astrology.

</div> 

In some cases, a Daimon is the raw energy of a planet. In other situations, Daimon might refer to a phase or a house and in yet others is a calculable point in a chart known later in the Islamic world as Arabic Lots or Parts. These points were definitely included in very early charts as important considerations, as has been shown by Dorian Greenbaum and Alexander Jones (in: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice).  
<br><br> 
There is a separate sections on <a href="daimon.html">&raquo; Planetary Daimons</a> disclosing and outlining a lot more information on the both the philosophical and technical varieties. In the philosophical versions, the descriptions and cautions about Daimons has over the millenia developed a momentum of its own, created a whole mythology of good and evil demons on the Earth, hampering human progress. These are the legendary notorious demons mentioned so often in black magic.

<h6>Revolution - The Sidereal Period</h6>

The time taken by each planetary body to complete one revolution by returning to any specified point on the ecliptic is known as its Sidereal Period, literally meaning its time to travel through the starry constellations. The Moon, Mercury and Venus, known as the inner planets, are faster than the sun and therefore they take less than one year. The outer planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn take longer than a year.

<p>Illustration from Johannes Kepler's description of a series of Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions, showing how consecutive conjunctions are mostly in the next triplicity (sign of the same element, here water) and then almost returning to the same degree as earlier, albeit a little further advanced.
</p>
</div>



<h6>Cycles and Phases</h6>

Sometimes planets can be extremely close to each other on the ecliptic and when this happens it is called a conjunction. In modern astrology, it is known as an aspect of conjunction and there are many other aspects such as an opposition, meaning most distant from each other. In ancient times though, the Hermetic system used a twelfth of the ecliptic to describe the separation. Each twelfth of the 360 degrees of the ecliptic is therefore 30 degrees, which is also the size of each zodiacal sign.
<br>
<br>
Older texts use the word phase (phasein in Greek) to denote how many 30 degree sections apart the planets are to be found in an astrological configuration drawn up as a chart. More modern translations and adaptations prefer sometimes to call them houses but that term has many different meanings. <br>
<br>
So, say for instance, Jupiter and Saturn happen to be separated by 100 degrees along the ecliptic, and Jupiter is ahead of Saturn, the configuration would be described as Jupiter in Saturn's fourth house or phase. This type of reckoning is distinctly part of Mesopotamian and Babylonian celestial divination of the Chaldean period, having been absorbed at the foundation of hermetic astrology.
<br>
<br>
In that ancient world, the study of these cycles, especially of Jupiter and Saturn, was employed to predict the fates and affairs of nations and their leaders. It was the Greek adaptation that turned it into the Astrology we know today. That also made way for all of the planets to be utilised in such a manner. Bearing all this in mind, it was the combined Greek and Egyptian contribution that systematised the celestial influences coming from the zodiac. The twelve signs impart twelve distinct characters upon the planets which pass through them.
<br>
<br>



<h2 class="title">All the Cycles</h2>


With lunar phases, such as at new or full moon, they are always with respect to the position of the sun as a reference point. The moon makes the phase to the sun. At full moon, this is at the start of phase seven, having already passed through the previous six phases since new moon. 

The same basic principle applies to any two planets, whereby the faster one makes a phase to the slower one. For instance, when considering the cycle of Jupiter and Saturn, Jupiter would be making a phase to Saturn, the slower planet.

</div>
The Phases of the Moon
<p>
Everyone is familiar with how the moon makes phases to the sun whereby the cycle is traditionally divided into four or eight parts. In phase astrology we use the Hermetic division of twelve. At new moon, the sun and moon are in the same degree of the ecliptic and are said to be in conjunction and at the start of phase one. At full moon, the moon has already passed through the first six phases and is then in opposition to the sun and entering phase seven.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>



<h6> Dynamic Rather Than Static</h6>

Astrological Charts are drawn up in a manner to intentionally freeze a moment in time to discover the character of that moment. This has the effect of more or less overlooking that which came before and that which is about to happen. 

The most important difference with phase astrology is that the movements of the planets are seen as dynamic. There is a cycle going on, and we glimpse at a moment of that cycle. This is more in keeping with the ancient Egyptian attitude of a stream of thought and consideration. In essence, it is Hermetic.

<h6>Houses</h6>

Of course, any planet moving through the zodiac, can make a phase to any chosen point on the ecliptic. This principle is employed over and again in various astrological techniques. The most obvious would be that of the modern system of house division. 

Astrological houses use a fixed reference point on the ecliptic called the Ascendant. It is simply the point rising on the eastern geographical horizon at the time of an event. Therefore when speaking of a planet in the fourth house, it could also be described as that planet being in phase four to the Ascendant. 
<br>
<br>




<h1 class="title">All the Cycles and Phases in Hermetical Astrology</h1>

Having a total of seven planets, there are altogether twenty-one possible cycles. These are listed in the table shown on the right. Each of these cycles has a particular meaning and the two planets involved in each cycle, and their signs, all have a particular character. So all twenty-one cycles have their meaning as well. The Jupiter-Saturn Cycle, for instance, starting at what was known as the Great Conjunction, was regarded as being an event so large that the futures of nations and rulers were at stake. It describes the greatest which is possible through benefic Jupiter and the boundary of conflict and restriction brought about by malefic Saturn. 
<br>
<br>

Decades of observation of the phases produced within all the cycles has revealed patterns and tendencies. The major issues produced by the planets in a cycle lie in the difficulty of seeing relevant examples or role models to help become and maintain that which is possible. As a fallback, the ease with which the issues of the previous phase are handled more often than not tempts the native into doing those things in preference to the more difficult ones at hand.
<br><br>

As an example, when social issues occurring in phase eleven seem to be indomitable, the person facing such difficulties can more readily escape into public affairs, the realm of phase ten. Here will be greater success and acclaim, such that everything appears to be as it should, as if destined to be that way. Yet those phase eleven issues will get in the way the longer they are pushed aside.

The Jupiter-Saturn cycle is not only of great historical importance, it is also the most significant for events or individuals. Jupiter strives to make its mark on the planet while Saturn seems to go out of its way to ensure that won't happen. Because these are the largest planets, the major issues here are the difficulty of becoming or growing into that which should be, and also  structuring and maintaining that which was possible. The tendency to operate within the realm of the previous phase is even greater than with the other cycles.

It's all about me.<br>
Cardinal, fiery and ruled by the brighter side of Mars, this is an energetic and enthusiastic phase. Usually single minded, there is a strong tendency to make a name for oneself. That is far more important than to what that name might be attached but the achievement will also be well remembered like a Ford car or a Dylan song. Important, most of all, was to establish something new, the start of that which was not there before. Whether it be Isaac Newton's first law of motion, Henry Ford's first mass produced car, Pablo Picasso's abstract art, or Jack Kerouac's Stream of consciousness (very Hermetic), there is no doubt these people are cultural pioneers. Like all phases, the source material lies in the realm of the previous phase, in this case Phase Twelve, so it should come as no surprise that Isaac Newton was a keen alchemist. John Lennon and Paul McCartney managed to create something new out of their vast musical knowledge and skills of what their predecessors had already achieved. Immanuel Kant managed to establish modern philosophy, yet only because of his particularly rational treatment of an  immense knowledge of what had been before.

There's More to Life Than This<br>
Wherever this phase is found there will be an enrichment created by a true artist at work. Perhaps a flourish, or some depth or drama, but there will surely be that something extra to make the experience more worth while. Most people who have heard the masterpieces of J. S. Bach will agree that he managed to turn music into a religious experience. The lavish brush strokes and use of colours in a Rembrandt painting are larger than life, leaving lasting impressions. The gripped tone and turn in the words of Kafka or Nietzsche have resonated with generations of readers. One can be sure the same be said of George Harrison's unexpected classics. Speaking of classics, where would the world be without Grimm's Fairy Tales, the product of an untiring effort from Jacob Grimm and his brother Wilhelm? When Curly Howard joined his brothers in The Three Stooges his elaborate improvisations were the very nature of their success. Archie Leach in a similar fashion reinvented himself as the actor Cary Grant, equally offstage as on, to become the Hollywood Icon for which he was famous.

Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practitioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
