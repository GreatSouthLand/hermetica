<b>Astronomy</b>
<br><br>
Astronomy is a science which concerns itself over using mathematical equations to determine the positions of the planets. Especially towards the end of the twentieth century with the advent of the computer, highly accurate predictions can be made.
<br>
<br>
This is rather ironic because it is the science making the prediction about that which has not happened, not Astrology. The planetary positions thus calculated enable Astrology to produce highly accurate results for more reliable interpretations.
<br>
<br>
To perform Cycle and Phase calculations for any particular point in time, it is therefore only necessary to have a program that will generate the necessary data. Traditionally the results of positional calculations were drawn up in tables called ephemerides. That is no longer necessary and the position of any two planets involved in a cycle may be quickly calculated and the relationship determined.

<h1 class="title">Cycles and Phases in Hermetical Astrology</h1>

One of the most important facets of Hermetic Astrology, which has been maintained in all branches of astrology ever since, is that of the comparison of planetary positions relative to each other. This was inherited from the Babylonian Study of the Great Conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn which were based upon celestial observations and predictions about where those planets would be at any particular date.

<h6>The Zodiac and The Planets </h6>

The entire system of astrology is based upon the apparent path of the Sun as seen from Earth which completes a full circle of 360 degrees in one year. This circle passes through twelve constellations named collectively as the Zodiac from the Greek word z≈çon, meaning that which can move itself, such as animals. The signs of the zodiac are often taken to be the animals but it actually refers to the planets being able to move themselves. Each Sign of the Zodiac spans thirty degrees of the ecliptic. All the other planets travel close to the path of the ecliptic taking a greater or lesser time to circle the Earth. 
<br>
<br>

The start of the Zodiac is at the intersection of the ecliptic with another celestial plane which extends out from the plane of the earth's equator. Since the ecliptic and the celestial equator lie at an angle of about 23 degrees to each they only intersect at two points. One marks the start of the ecliptic at zero degrees of Aries, the first sign of the zodiac. The other is directly opposite, separated by 180 degrees at zero degrees of Libra.
<br>
<br>


<h2 class="title">12 Signs, 12 Calendar Months, and 12 Clock Hours</h2>


The ecliptic being divided into twelve sections is no accident. This special number was inherited from both the Babylonian and Egyptian systems of time keeping and divination. For all cultures, time keeping has always been of paramount importance and was derived from the phenomena occurring in the heavens. The most obvious of such would be the Sun's movement throughout the year as well as the Moon throughout each month. For some, such as the ancient Egyptians, the rising and falling of the constellations of fixed stars, both daily and yearly, were fundamental. 

<div class="rboxc" style="clear:right; width:30%; margin:20px 0px 0px 20px;">
<img src="img/cycles/astro_clock.jpg" alt="source: wikipedia" class="modal-img" onclick="clk(this)">
<p>Astronomical Clock with Signs of the Zodiac</p>
</div>

<br>
<br>
 
Time-reckoning based upon the apparent movement of the Sun through its yearly cycle around the earth is called a solar calendar. Although not part of calendar time, the daily rising and setting of the Sun was equally important, forming the basis of clock-time. Some early calendars were based upon the Moon and its phases and are now referred to as lunar calendars. The modern Islamic calendar is an example of a lunar calendar. The most obvious event happening for the Moon naturally is the full moon when the sun is directly opposite the Moon and shines fully over its face. When the Sun and Moon are near each other on the ecliptic, a New Moon occurs and since the light reflected by the Moon is at a minimum, its face is not visible. 
<br>
<br>
Every new or full moon is known as a syzygy, an ancient Greek term meaning yoked together. The time between two syzygies is called a lunation which takes about 29.5 days. Therefore there are always twelve complete lunations each and every year. At the time when the solar and lunar calendar systems were merged into lunisolar calendars, such as used in the modern western world, the result was a year of twelve months and correspondingly twelve astrological signs aligned to those months. 
In 731BC, Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, decided to line the calendar up with the phases of the moon.
<br>
<br>
The ancient time reckoners were keen mathematicians and quickly noticed that the number twelve is easily divided by two, three, four and six and these divisions produce very important astrologically symbolic meaning. When these were inherited by the Arab world, a lot of the numerical symbolism was absorbed into and elaborated upon and used to form a system of number magic, part of which later turned into numerology, at the start of the 20th century, previously known as arithmancy. This is rather useful, because the significance of particular numbers can be applied directly to many areas of astrological symbolism.

<h6>Divided into Two - As Above, So Below - Day and Night</h6>

The division of the ecliptic into two parts naturally has one half above the horizon, known as diurnal meaning of the daytime. The other half is nocturnal or of the night. Planets which are above the horizon are diurnal and portray more open and obvious characters. Conversely nocturnal planets below the horizon are in the dark and are regarded traditionally as weaker, negative and possible detrimental. Within the realms of phases and houses, the first six would be regarded as nocturnal and relate to private concerns. The last six are diurnal and relate to the impersonal, public or partner's concerns.
<br>
<br>

<h6>Divided into Three - An Element For Each</h6>

When the ecliptic is divided into three groups of four, each group is made up of the four different elements in the order of fire, earth, air, and water. The pattern repeats around the circle. The first group consists of fiery Aries, earthy Taurus, airy Gemini and watery Cancer and are the most personal. The next four, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio are concerned with close personal relationships, while Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces deal with public, impersonal or universal issues.
<br>
<br>

<h6>Divided into Four - Seasons of The Sun</h6>

The starting point of the ecliptic is at the Vernal Equinox which is the start of Spring in the northern hemisphere. The circle is then divided into the four seasons and correspondingly, the first three signs of the zodiac, Aries, Taurus and Gemini are regarded as Vernal Signs, Spring like. The next three, Cancer, Leo and Virgo are related to Summer, then Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius are autumnal, and finally Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are the signs of Winter.

The Ecliptic - Path of the Sun
<p>
Viewed from the Earth, the sun takes one calendar year to complete its cycle in a great circular path known as the ecliptic which is divided into the twelve signs of the zodiac. It's called the ecliptic because it is where eclipses occur.
</p>
</div> 


<h2 class="title">All the Signs of The Zodiac</h2>


The circle of the Zodiac contains twelve signs, each with a different symbolic character. Even though for most astrological applications these are treated as discreet (separate) entities, the zodiac itself is continuous. In Hermetic Astrology, there is a natural transition from one sign to another. The last degrees of one sign are already showing the character of the next.
<br>
<br>
As well as that, throughout each sign, the degree ranges from zero to thirty which naturally can also affect the intensity and meaning of the sign's symbolism. In a low degree there is greater enthusiasm to become involved with the world through expressing the nature of whatever might be positioned at that degree, for instance, a planet. At a higher degree a person experiences the issues at hand, as having a much greater importance. 
<br>
<br>
Issues representing smaller degrees will have many more examples at hand in the world. Larger degrees are less often encountered but when they are, the gravity of the situation calls for a different strategy for dealing with them. It is important to note that someone who experiences various issues of low degrees might not necessarily perceive those of larger degrees. These people simpler pass over the topic as if were not there. Conversely the person worried about the larger picture could easily see another person's low degree issues, no matter how frequent, as being unimportant.
<br>
<br>
The whole circle of the Zodiac can be viewed in a similar way to that of the "Fool's Journey" through the Major Arcana of the Tarot. In our case, the fool starts out at Aries, keen and unaware of pitfalls or dangers. Travelling through each of the twelve signs, the native acquires some things in life whether they be material stuff or experiences from interacting with the world. The outcome is to end up at the last sign, Pisces, which is concerned about everything in the world, cosmos or universe, exoterically and esoterically. This can escalate to the ultimate need of starting over again with that which has been learnt and become a new type of fool.
<br>
<br>
The passage of the planets through the signs is never ending and at birth we step into this flow not knowing what it is, where it is going or especially from where it came. Hermetic Astrology can start to reveal all this information. By applying the symbolism of the signs of the zodiac to various other astrological cycles we can soon discover that the twelve phases of any cycle maintain the same symbolic nature as that of the zodiacal signs.
<br>
<br>

So how would the symbolism of the first sign, Aries, turn into that of Taurus, the second sign? Some tables are presented here in order to elaborate.

<h6>Planetary Rulers of the Signs</h6>

Each of the twelve signs is associated with a ruling planet, known appropriately as its ruler. Once again this is not arbitrary and the ancients thought out a scheme of allocation. Since the Sun and Moon, known together as the luminaries or the lights, are extremely important in any chart the rulerships start with them. The sign with most affinity to the Sun is Leo and that for the Moon is Cancer. This effectively divides the signs into two groups sometimes referred to as the solar and lunar sections. Around the circle the polarities change from positive (outgoing, expressive) to negative (receptive, creative).

<h6>Planetary Rulers of the Weekdays</h6>

<p>The Days of the Week<br>and Their Rulers</p>
</div>

That there are seven days to the week and seven planets is no coincidence. The planets are associated using a particular pattern, once again based on the Hermetic Chaldean Order. As is seen in the diagram to the left, that order, starting with  the Moon at the top, runs clockwise through the Chaldean Order, finishing with Saturn. Starting at the Moon and Monday, its namesake, and following the arrows, the weekdays are encountered in the correctly known order.
<br>
<br>
Whether or not it was the earliest, a seven day week was decreed by King Sargon I of Akkad, sometime around 2300 BCE. Sargon managed to form the very first known empire in Mesopotamia, known as the Akkadian Empire, uniting Sumerian and Akkadian speaking peoples.
<br>
<br>
The ancient mathematicians who observed the celestial objects for their timekeeping were also aware of the fact that a lunation takes 28 days and that four weeks of seven days each fit neatly into the scheme of things. Those four weeks align nicely with the four well known phases of the Moon, namly new, first quarter, full and last quarter. 


<hr class="blank h20">

<div id="hours"></div>


<h6>Planetary Hours</h6>

When the rulers of the weekdays were allocated, something else was noticed by the ancients. When considering planetary hours, the daytime from sunrise to sunset is divided into twelve equal segments. The night time from sunset to the next sunrise. is also divided by twelve. When the daylight is longer than the darkness, the day hours will be longer than regular clock hours, the night hours being shorter,
<br>
<br>
The day begins at sunrise, as was the case in ancient times and still is for some modern time keeping, a day's ruling planet is also allocated to the first hour of the new day. The subsequent 24 hours are then ruled by the planets in a reversed Chaldean Order, from Saturn to Moon. The 25th hour just happens to be the same planet as the ruler of the next day.

<p>An Example of a Clock <br> Showing Planetary Hours.</p>
</div>

As an example, take any Saturday, with its ruler as Saturn. Starting at sunrise, the first hour is also ruled by Saturn. The next by Jupiter, then by Mars and so forth. The 25th hour, which is the first hour of the next day, Sunday, will happen to be ruled by the Sun, automatically.

</div>


<br>
In the example of a planetary hour clock shown on the left, the grey area represents night time, the white part day time. The black line running through the middle of day and night runs from the Nadir, lowest point of the sun, at mid-night, to the Zenith, the highest point of the Sun, at mid-day. The red line is like a clock hand which says that the current hour is ruled by the M00n. 
<br>
<br>
This particular clock starts at the lowest point marked as 0 for midnight. The upper left edge of the grey area shows the end of the previous night and therefore the sunrise of the current day, just before 6 o'clock, with Saturn ruling the first hour, so it is a Saturday. The day continues until the last planetary hour, ruled by Venus, up to just past 9 o'oclock in the evening. The clock display ends at the 0, for midnight of this particular day.

<h6>You Can Do Magic</h6>

For millennia, all of these rulerships have been employed in other branches of the Hermetic Arts, such as Magic (manipulation of the physical world), Medicine (treatment with substances), Theurgy (commanding of spirits) or Alchemy (transformation of matter or spirit). The rulerships are mainly used to time events in the practice of these arts in order to utilise desirable planetary energies on available hours and days and so on.
<br><br>

When it comes to the older Hermetic versions of these arts, there are  philosophical concepts underlying the practice which involve Planetary Daimons. A Daimon is a sort of half-god, partly of the created world, partly of the divine world. The ancient Greek word Daimon (Œ¥Œ±ŒØŒºœâŒΩ), refers to lesser divinities or spirits, and is used in various contexts within Hermetic Astrology.

Horoscope from the year 319 CE showing a table of calculated Daimons. 
</div> 

In some cases, a Daimon is the raw energy of a planet. In other situations, Daimon might refer to a phase or a house and in yet others is a calculable point in a chart known later in the Islamic world as Arabic Lots or Parts. These points were definitely included in very early charts as important considerations, as has been shown by Dorian Greenbaum and Alexander Jones (in: An elaborate horoscope for 319 CE and its significance for Greek astronomical and astrological practice).  
<br><br> 
There is a separate sections on <a href="daimon.html">&raquo; Planetary Daimons</a> disclosing and outlining a lot more information on the both the philosophical and technical varieties. In the philosophical versions, the descriptions and cautions about Daimons has over the millenia developed a momentum of its own, created a whole mythology of good and evil demons on the Earth, hampering human progress. These are the legendary notorious demons mentioned so often in black magic.

</div>

<h2 class="title">Revolution - The Sidereal Period</h2>

The time taken by each planetary body to complete one revolution by returning to any specified point on the ecliptic is known as its Sidereal Period, literally meaning its time to travel through the starry constellations. The Moon, Mercury and Venus, known as the inner planets, are faster than the sun and therefore they take less than one year. The outer planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn take longer than a year.
<br><br>


<h6>Cycles and Phases</h6>

Sometimes planets can be extremely close to each other on the ecliptic and when this happens it is called a conjunction. In modern astrology, it is known as an aspect of conjunction and there are many other aspects such as an opposition, meaning most distant from each other. In ancient times though, the Hermetic system used a twelfth of the ecliptic to describe the separation. Each twelfth of the 360 degrees of the ecliptic is therefore 30 degrees, which is also the size of each zodiacal sign.
<br><br>

Older texts use the word phase (phasein in Greek) to denote how many 30 degree sections apart the planets are to be found in an astrological configuration drawn up as a chart. More modern translations and adaptations prefer sometimes to call them houses but that term has many different meanings. 
<br><br>

So, say for instance, Jupiter and Saturn happen to be separated by 100 degrees along the ecliptic, and Jupiter is ahead of Saturn, the configuration would be described as Jupiter in Saturn's fourth house or phase. This type of reckoning is distinctly part of Mesopotamian and Babylonian celestial divination of the Chaldean period, having been absorbed at the foundation of hermetic astrology.
<br><br>

In that ancient world, the study of these cycles, especially of Jupiter and Saturn, was employed to predict the fates and affairs of nations and their leaders. It was the Greek adaptation that turned it into the Astrology we know today. That also made way for all of the planets to be utilised in such a manner. Bearing all this in mind, it was the combined Greek and Egyptian contribution that systematised the celestial influences coming from the zodiac. The twelve signs impart twelve distinct characters upon the planets which pass through them.
<br><br>

Even though when Hermetic Astrology was first invented, producing a neat symbolic system of seven planets, fitting both mathematically and numerically, the three more recently observed objects moving along the ecliptic are still worth a mention. Indeed, modern astrologers would include them in their charts and interpretations. Those who don't, prefer to call their work traditional or ancient.
<br><br>

With respect to the rulerships of the star signs of the zodiac, the original designation has simply been extended past the Chaldean Order to produce co-rulers of the signs, generally referred to as a higher octave of the original planet.

<h6>Planetary Cycles and Synodic Periods</h6>

While a sidereal period tells us how long a planet takes for a single orbit, the time between conjunctions of two planets is known as the synodic period, from he word synod meaning meeting. By using the values of the sidereal periods, we may calculate synodic periods using the following using the formula: 
<br><br>
(1&nbsp;/&nbsp;synodic&nbsp;period)&nbsp;=&nbsp;(1&nbsp;/&nbsp;smaller&nbsp;sidereal&nbsp;period)&nbsp;-&nbsp;(1&nbsp;/&nbsp;larger&nbsp;sidereal&nbsp;period)
<br>
as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example,&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jupiter-Saturn&nbsp;cycle:&nbsp;synodic&nbsp;period&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;/&nbsp;(&nbsp;1&nbsp;/&nbsp;11.86&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;/&nbsp;29.46&nbsp;)&nbsp;=&nbsp;19.86&nbsp;years&nbsp;
<br><br>

Generally, the Jupiter-Saturn cycle is regarded as being 20 years long meaning that there are 20 years between successive conjunctions, oppositions and so on. The synodic period of the Sun and Moon is called a synodic month, having a duration of 29.53059 days, which is the average time from one New Moon to the next, known as the lunation cycle. Any two planets form a synodic period and these may be calculated using the same method. The following table lists all the possible combinations for the ten planets using the same calculation as above but substituting the appropriate sidereal values already mentioned. The Moon's cycles are of course the shortest, the most well known being the Sun-Moon cycle which causes the lunar phases of the synodic month.
<br><br>



<h2 class="title">All the Cycles</h2>


With lunar phases, such as at new or full moon, they are always with respect to the position of the sun as a reference point. The moon makes the phase to the sun. At full moon, this is at the start of phase seven, having already passed through the previous six phases since new moon. 

The same basic principle applies to any two planets, whereby the faster one makes a phase to the slower one. For instance, when considering the cycle of Jupiter and Saturn, Jupiter would be making a phase to Saturn, the slower planet.

</div>
The Phases of the Moon
<p>
Everyone is familiar with how the moon makes phases to the sun whereby the cycle is traditionally divided into four or eight parts. In phase astrology we use the Hermetic division of twelve. At new moon, the sun and moon are in the same degree of the ecliptic and are said to be in conjunction and at the start of phase one. At full moon, the moon has already passed through the first six phases and is then in opposition to the sun and entering phase seven.

<h6> Dynamic Rather Than Static</h6>

Astrological Charts are drawn up in a manner to intentionally freeze a moment in time to discover the character of that moment. This has the effect of more or less overlooking that which came before and that which is about to happen. 

The most important difference with phase astrology is that the movements of the planets are seen as dynamic. There is a cycle going on, and we glimpse at a moment of that cycle. This is more in keeping with the ancient Egyptian attitude of a stream of thought and consideration. In essence, it is Hermetic.

<h6>Houses</h6>

Of course, any planet moving through the zodiac, can make a phase to any chosen point on the ecliptic. This principle is employed over and again in various astrological techniques. The most obvious would be that of the modern system of house division. Astrological houses use a fixed reference point on the ecliptic called the Ascendant. It is simply the point rising on the eastern geographical horizon at the time of an event. The twelve divisiona starting at the horizon are relative to the world and are therefore properly called mundane houses. When speaking of a planet in the fourth house, it could also be described as that planet being in phase four to the Ascendant. 
<br><br>


<h6>Heaven Turns - Cosmic Cycles</h6>

The rhythms of the cosmos flow eternally. Birth is the significant moment of becoming a separate entity and joining in on that flow. The place and time of birth denote the basis of personal identity underlying motivation for future actions. Astrological observation is a look at the sky from that place at that moment and represents cosmic identity. It not only describes the pull of the eternal flow of the universe's movements but also the inherent momentum. Life is a blend of being carried along by transient cosmic forces and the reshaping caused by our own utilisation of that personal momentum. Identity creates the circumstances that facilitate development of characteristics recorded astrologically. Outward symbols are sought to represent inner conditions in the hope of self-realisation. If the symbols are not at hand imagination attempts to create them. When this is unsuccessful distress arises. Usually though, the attempts are modified and tried again.
<br><br>

Astrology can offer a description of what issue caused the circumstances, why it arose, how it is being handled and what the ultimate aim and outcome may be. The root of the issue is the nature of the cycle into which a person was born. The particular phase of the cycle shows the formative stage of an issue that rises out of the individual expression of the cycle's function. Each cycle has a function that goes through different phases and each phase reflects an issue of varying degrees. The degree describes the magnitude of circumstances surrounding the individual born into that degree of that phase of that cycle.
<br><br>

Every cycle has a unique meaning derived from the function of interchange between two planetary symbols. With the ten planets there is a total of forty-five possible functions. Pluto is the planet of the longest sidereal period so all of the nine other planets make phases to it. On the other end of the scale the Moon has the shortest period making phases to all other planets but having none making a phase to it. Effectively it becomes an end of the chain under the influence of all the other planets. In medieval astrology before the discovery of the outer planets the other end of the chain was Saturn, regarded as the outermost planet symbolising ultimate control. Beyond Saturn was Heaven, called Ouranos by the Greeks. Uranus is now the name of  the planet that challenged Saturn's status as being the outermost reach. Since its discovery, two more planets have revealed themselves to be Neptune and Pluto. Currently Pluto is at the outermost reach of our Solar System and is the one not making a phase to any other. The table below shows all the possible combinations for the planetary cycles.

<p>Cosmic Wheels</p>
</div>


Pluto is the reference for nine cycles, Neptune eight, Uranus seven, Saturn six, Jupiter five, Mars four, Sun three, Venus two, Mercury one and the Moon none. Each planet is involved in nine different cycles. Sometimes a planet is the reference but when it's not, it's the phase-maker.
<br><br>

Planets closest to each other by sidereal period form the most important cycles. They represent a transfer of one planetary function to the next. For instance, the Moon has the shortest sidereal period and its cycle is experienced with the highest frequency. The next most frequent that we experience is that of Mercury's. We would therefore expect that the principles of these two are closely related. When considering the relationship between Moon and Mercury it is important to note that these two planets are representative of different parts of the mind. Mercury symbolises neutral thoughts or ideas of the rational mind whereas the Moon is the symbol for the emotional side of the mental state, the flow of dreams and imagination, the irrational mind. The cycle therefore would indicate how thoughts affect the subconscious to produce the mentality.
<br><br>

The rhythms of planets in all the transfer cycles are next to each other in our experience. At conjunction, they get closer to each other, rhythmically, than is possible to other planets, thereby allowing the one with the longer sidereal period to have its then greatest effect and at opposition it displays its least effect. In all there are nine cycles of this type. One of these in particular, the Jupiter Saturn cycle, was always of great interest to astrologers. Consideration of these two planets was employed to study the rise and fall of nations, outcomes in battles and the future of leaders. This was derived from examination of the growth factor of the Jupiterian principle in the context of a Saturnian framework, revealing possibilities and limitations for national expansion beyond existing boundaries. This probably overshadowed all other astrological investigation since the affairs of ordinary individuals were not of such great importance. Individuals were ultimately controlled by the state and the exercise of individual will was secondary, if important at all.
<br><br>




<h6>Cycles of Transfer</h6>

In the ancient world, cycles of close planets traditionally transfer their energy onto the next planet in order, Pluto to Neptune to Uranus to Saturn to Jupiter to Mars to Sun to Venus to Mercury to Moon. The phase-maker receives the impulse from the reference. It is the reference planet that establishes the subject of the function and it is up to the phase-maker to make what it can of the subject. This is where the issues arise. This is the phase of the cycle.

A Square to Moon
</div>


The more recently discovered planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, are regarded astrologically as being beyond the ordinary level of everyday existence. They are called the extra-personal or super-personal planets. Their slowness causes large groups of people to have them in a similar position at birth. Ancient astrology considered Saturn to be the outermost limit of consciousness and even today it well describes the blocks that obstruct transcendence of the mundane. Every individual has a multitude of problems each and every day so that consideration of anything beyond the personal is only possible when demanded by extreme situations. These are the emergencies of social change.
<br><br>

The meanings of the outer cycles are generally beyond our comprehension because their effects only become evident over long periods of time, much longer than the life-span of an individual. Only by looking at history and combining this with the symbolism of these planets may we deduce their functions. This is achieved by working outwards from the Saturnian restriction of our existence.
<br><br>

Saturn equates to society. The sudden upheavals that occasionally affect society are the result of the erratic, unpredictable and sometimes violent nature of Uranus. This planet is also connected to inventiveness, another modifier of the way societies function. Uranus challenges Saturn's crystalline structures. On an individual level, every person is challenged by Uranus to be aware of personal power. Calamity occurs when change is unexpected. If someone's consciousness crystallises, there will not be enough flexibility to adapt to inevitable Uranian change. Some Uranian type people are the agents of that change by being inventors, reformers or dissidents. Their actions show as the effect of the Uranus Saturn cycle.
<br><br>

The Uranian inventiveness is activated by problems presented by an even smaller group of radicals who live within the realm of the Neptune Uranus cycle. These people derive their originality from Neptunian imagination. Neptune is the planet of faith that binds people into a common cause. When faith becomes insistent Uranus is stirred into action.
<br><br>


Pluto rules transformation and its effect on Neptune is to challenge the authenticity of a belief system despite the existence of its rivals. The result of such an enquiry is to reduce human behaviour to its raw essence. Pluto demands the release of unfounded belief so that true human nature may be revealed and intensified. Needless to say, very few people in the history of the human race have taken up the cudgel against a current faith. This would be flying in the face of Plutonian violence and would require a highly skilled, strong and cautious individual.
<br><br>

The majority of people are generally too busy with immediate affairs to tackle such large tasks. Their concerns cover a range of existential issues from national to domestic. This is the realm of traditional astrology from the field of Saturn to that of the Moon. The planetary issues are closer to the individual when the planet is shorter in its sidereal period. Saturn rules generalities and the Moon specifics. Working inwards from Saturn towards the Moon we may deduce the effects of these traditional planets.
<br><br>

Saturn, planet of structures, affects Jupiter, planet of expansion: The structure of society dictates the individual's ability to grow within it. The individual desire for increase is shown by Jupiter's position at birth. Saturn's position indicates the personal comprehension of society. Therefore the Jupiter Saturn cycle is the social function. The social framework of Saturn allows Jupiter a varied amount of effectiveness. Jupiter is wanting expansion and induces Mars, planet of action, to be active. The type of activity is described by the phase that Mars makes to Jupiter. But for Mars to be active, energy, symbolised by the Sun, is required. The Mars Sun cycle shows where energy is poured into action. Our primary source of energy is food, ruled by Venus, planet of indulgence. The Sun beams on Venus with the explicit need for sustenance. The food that Venus eats produces the body and the body's mannerisms. But it's not enough for Venus, in repose, to merely want food, for it to appear, so the need for expression arises. This is passed to Mercury to speak of such things and the phase in which Venus does this to Mercury shows the person's eloquence. Mercury is a nervous planet and nervousness generated from inadequate delivery of the mind's thoughts, is passed onto the responses of the Moon. The mental capacity affects the mental condition as perception indicated by the phase in this cycle.

Calculations
</div>
<h6>Finding Phases - Calculation </h6>

To determine the phase between two planets at any moment during a cycle the longitude of the reference is subtracted from that of the phase-maker and the result is divided by the thirty degrees of a complete phase. The remainder is the degree within the phase.
<br><br>

Phase = (Degree of Phase-maker - Degree of Reference) / 30
<br><br>
whereby the phase-maker is the planet with the shorter sidereal period
<br><br>

Note that the planet with a shorter sidereal period can‚Äôt be referred to as the faster of the two planets being compared because around and during retrograde motion it may actually be moving slower than the other. The phases are not derived from the speed of the planets but the size of their cycles through the zodiac.
<br><br>

As an example, if we are trying to find the phase between Jupiter and Saturn at midnight of the 1st of January 2000, we need to first find both planets‚Äô zodiacal positions of sign, degree and minute and convert these to the absolute longitudes measured in degrees of 0 to 360 in distance from 0¬∞ Aries along the ecliptic (zodiac). Next we subtract the position of the planet with the longer sidereal period in this case Saturn from the position of the planet with the shorter period, Jupiter and then finally divide the result by 30 which is the number of degrees in a phase.
<br><br>

Our sublunary existence, inferior on the planetary scale, is subjected to vast cosmic influences despite our limited awareness of them. We are always entangled in a myriad of predicaments, interrelated and confused. Consciousness is clouded by the issues that we encourage around us while trying to discover our own identities. True identity is a blend of individual expressions of the planetary principles prevailing at birth. The method employed to discover this potential is to involve ourselves in a countless variety of issues ranging from personal to cosmic in the hope of stumbling on self-realisation. These issues usually become so baffling that they eventually obstruct the discovery they were intended to reveal. Furthermore because we don't know what it is that we are seeking, we don't recognise it even if we fall over it.
<br><br>

The potential of a person is the identity present at birth. Identity causes a range of personal experiences aiming at self-awareness by provoking issues out of the experiences that are available. Everyone is unique, each having an individual mode of expression. What is being expressed is the reinforcement of the planetary principles. The sign and degree in which a planet is positioned modifies the planetary effect available at any moment and this begins at birth.

Everyone enters the flow of cosmic cycles part way through its rhythm. The first day that is experienced in anyone's life is the twenty-four hours from the time of birth to that same time the next day. The first experience of the duration of a day is the first recurrence of the daily cycle as a correspondence to the Sun's position in the sky, the basis of clock-time. Each of us has a daily rhythm originating from the birth time. Our energies ebb and flow according to that rhythm. As we grow older our experience of the passage of time increases. We learn the significance of clocks and calendars and utilise them to assist us in developing routines. We are synchronised to solar and lunar rhythms. This allows the principles symbolised by the Sun and Moon to be much better understood.
<br><br>

In astrology we have a greater awareness of this, regarding them as the most important planets. Whenever a traditional chart is drawn they are placed at the top of the planetary list, are granted the dignified title of the Lights and given the greatest emphasis in interpretation. Perhaps if we could follow the cycles of other planets and develop a routine according to their rhythms then all the planets would be equally significant.
<br><br>

As an example of discovering new planetary awareness we can look at the rhythm of Jupiter, planet of expansion, in relation to Saturn, planet of restriction. The cycle involving these two planets is more pronounced than might be first expected. The Jupiterian principle of expansion is fundamental to the process of life, evident as growth and movement. All the possibilities of an organism fall broadly under this category.
<br><br>

Saturn, on the other hand, indicates how growth is limited, as the realisation of an organism's specific form. This defines actual physical existence at any stage of life. Restrictions may be external as environmental factors that affect the well-being, as well as internal factors such as the inherent nature of the organism and its individual condition. Therefore Jupiter shows what is wanting to be achieved and Saturn shows what may be allowed. The Jupiter Saturn cycle reveals the situation for the individual within the impersonal framework. In effect it describes subjective reality - the personal world.
<br><br>

To discover the nature of this personal world we need to look at the particular Jupiter Saturn cycle into which someone was born. Successive conjunctions between Saturn and Jupiter occur approximately every twenty years, the synodic period. For a sample period of two hundred years the conjunctions occur as follows:

Having a total of seven traditional planets, there are altogether twenty-one possible cycles. These are listed in the table shown on the right. Each of these cycles has a particular meaning and the two planets involved in each cycle, and their signs, all have a particular character. So all twenty-one cycles have their meaning as well. The Jupiter-Saturn Cycle, for instance, starting at what was known as the Great Conjunction, was regarded as being an event so large that the futures of nations and rulers were at stake. It describes the greatest which is possible through benefic Jupiter and the boundary of conflict and restriction brought about by malefic Saturn. 

Decades of observation of the phases produced within all the cycles has revealed patterns and tendencies. The major issues produced by the planets in a cycle lie in the difficulty of seeing relevant examples or role models to help become and maintain that which is possible. As a fallback, the ease with which the issues of the previous phase are handled more often than not tempts the native into doing those things in preference to the more difficult ones at hand.
<br><br>

As an example, when social issues occurring in phase eleven seem to be indomitable, the person facing such difficulties can more readily escape into public affairs, the realm of phase ten. Here will be greater success and acclaim, such that everything appears to be as it should, as if destined to be that way. Yet those phase eleven issues will get in the way the longer they are pushed aside.
<br><br>


Altogether there are forty-five different cycles that offer topics of interest to astrological investigation. Each cycle's meaning is derived from consideration of the individual principles of the planets involved and then, through an overview of their relationship, a general implication of the combination is developed. As well as the transfer cycles already mentioned we may also investigate the complete set as a whole.
<br>
<br>Transfer cycles present the most pressing issues that are possible. The chances of functioning efficiently within these cycles depends largely upon the availability of suitable role models and the opportunity for expression. When this is not available, the planetary principles become more urgent in the functions of the other cycles. For instance if the Jupiter Saturn issue is unmanageable then Saturn will have its influence revealed as control over other planets. Likewise Jupiter will seek to expand other planetary principles if its own expansion is thwarted. So all the forty-five different cycles are occasionally emphasized.
<br>
<br>Situations that evoke issues must involve at least one phase. The choice is an unconscious decision but generally it's the one that has the highest priority at the time. If an issue is unresolved and is a direct concern, new events will be dragged into it, even if they have no obvious connection.
<br>
<br>The reference defines the general nature of a cycle. It is the director of the function actualized by the planet which makes a phase to it. For example, any cycle that involves Pluto, slowest of all the planets, necessarily has a Plutonian feel to it. Pluto Moon cycles, for example, make themselves obvious through Plutonian types of lunar response. On the other hand the Moon's effect on Pluto is negligible. The Moon is simply being an agent of Pluto.
<br>
<br>The reference remains relatively stable compared to the phase-maker whose motion is necessarily more noticeable. The Moon being the smallest of all the planets has the most irregular motion falling sway to the effects of all the others. Although the path of the Moon appears to be erratic it may be predicted by fully considering all the perturbations. Since the Moon is affected so much by the larger planets its position indicates the most erratic behaviour that a person may show. An individual's most immediate response hinges on the nature of the cycles in which the Moon is involved.
<br>
<br>Just as the reference planet relates to the cycle, the phase-maker relates to the phase. This represents a cause and its effect. The nature of the phase is one of twelve possible areas of involvement within the functional parameters of the planetary relationship. It modifies the expression according to the influence. This influence flowing from the reference planet is of course also changing since it is also moving and being affected by other influences. To get an idea of how planets function as references we can look at all the different possible cycles in which they are involved.

<h6>Pluto is the Reference for Nine Cycles</h6>

Pluto rules the underworld, the region of yet unknown forces. It is the planet of secrets, subconscious, unconscious, occult. Anything that is not accessible via ordinary sensory perception but nevertheless persists in being evident, falls under the heading of Pluto. This is the planet that causes the ultimate questions about existence of the essence of life and its regeneration through death. Whenever Pluto is involved in a cycle, transformation occurs, whereby the principle of the other planet receives the ultimate challenge to its expression. Pluto destroys what is not intrinsic to its nature resulting in an intensification of true properties.
<br>
<br>
The cycles to the outer planets have very long synodic periods and are indicative of slow changes on a grand scale. These are the issues of humanity and only affect individuals collectively. This area is under investigation by mundane astrology which is concerned with national, international and political matters. On a more personal level, the Pluto effect is more noticeable with the faster moving planets. The immediacy of the personal planets makes the function much more accessible.

<h6>Neptune is the Reference for Eight Cycles</h6>

Neptune is the ruler of the sea in all its mysterious depths. This giant planet, slow moving like ocean currents, flows through and around irresistibly. The vastness of Neptune evades containment or control and in fact its persistence erodes and dissolves seemingly permanent structures. It is the planet that causes gradual change like a river changing its course. The short term effects are barely perceptible but the result is undeniable. Neptune highlights the importance of collectivity. An ocean is a vast body of water whose effect is far greater than that of the drops that comprise it. It really only has its influence by affecting large numbers concurrently.
<br>
<br>
Humans are sensory creatures and wish to perceive the world, believing this to be rational and correct. Whether this is natural or taught is inconsequential to the immaterial quality of Neptune. Even so, humans want to nevertheless interpret the Neptunian influence as sensible. This impression of the subjective experience of Neptune is known as imagination. Perhaps it is because of the uncertainty of Neptune's effect on the world that humanity has employed imagination to anticipate possible consequence.

<h6>Uranus is the Reference for Seven Cycles</h6>

The unexpected discovery of Uranus in 1781 shook and almost completely disintegrated the astronomical, astrological and cosmological world views. The outer limits of the Solar system could no longer be accepted as being at the orbit of Saturn. All the philosophy and assumed facts that were based on the Saturnian limits of the Middle Ages were suddenly invalid. This planet has been accredited all the qualities of its effect on social norms and is now regarded as being  disruptive in the most unexpected if not violent manner.
<br>
<br>
Uranus lies outside the orbit of Saturn and Uranian influence makes itself known by striking terror into the heart of stability. Because the effects of Uranus are so dramatic the cause is somewhat masked and unobvious. But the effect should not be mistaken for the cause. Uranus represents that which is beyond our expectation. Whenever an assumption is made there is always the possibility for surprise. Nothing is absolute and to our limited awareness there is no certainty, no matter how much it is desired. It is the lack of flexibility in human perception and reaction that allows Uranian influence to be regarded as destructive. If an overview were possible the natural progression would be obvious.

<h6>Saturn is the Reference for Six Cycles</h6>

Saturn rules boundaries. It is the planet of limitation, restriction, containment and control. Saturn defines frameworks and structures. Bodysize, for instance, is dictated by skeletal structure. A small creature with a small skeleton can't grow any larger than its skeleton will allow. Any attempt to do so can only make it a bigger specimen of its own species. This is a Saturnian type of restriction. Being aware of physical possibilities before reaching boundaries avoids the discovery that attempting the impossible is only frustrating. If this is ignored the control comes from outside. This is the area of personal responsibility. A responsible person has self-control, an irresponsible one expects Saturn ruled society to provide the control. The planets making phases to Saturn are subject to that control.
<br>
<br>
Saturn's position at the time of birth offers a personalized description of an individual's possibilities. Its relationship in cycles with other planets describes their limitations as frustrated expression. The phases show the area where restriction will be at its greatest. This of course may be self-imposed and repressive or else externally administered and oppressive. The planets affected most by Saturn are the faster moving personal planets and this shows that it is the individual that is being controlled by the agency of Saturn.
<pre>

<hr class="blank">

<h6>Jupiter is the Reference for Five Cycles</h6>

Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar-system. Its influence urges everything to increase in size and importance. Any means by which to achieve this is also in the Jupiterian realm, through the natural process of growth or fortune and luck. As ruler of Sagittarius, Jupiter shows a masculine side that's fiery and outwardly expressive. The complementary counterpart is represented by the feminine introspective Pisces. The mutability of these signs makes them unstable which shows in Sagittarius as adventurousness, imposing itself upon the world, and in Pisces as cosmic inordinacy as the world becomes an imposition. Both see the world as a challenge.
<br>
<br>
The cycles affected by Jupiter reveal where optimism should prevail. Jupiter is traditionally a benefic planet endowing all it touches with the greatest of fortune. This comes about through the absolute belief in success and the pursuit of it with single-minded optimism. Jupiterian activity usually causes tunnel-vision focussing on the aim and ignoring any peripheral events that might be distracting.
<br>
<br>
The type of expansion that Jupiter seeks is described by its position in the chart. The character of the sign in which it is placed defines the general attitude of the individual. All optimism originates from this source.
<pre>

     Jupiter Moon     Expansive response          Indulgence
</pre>


<hr class="blank">

<h6>Mars is the Reference for Four Cycles</h6>

Mars is the planet of destruction, an integral and necessary force for the process of life. Mars takes life to produce food. The digestion of food is also a destructive process that violently breaks apart organic tissues converting them into energy. The regenerative process is also Martian. In fact, Mars rules everything to do with survival. Its aggressive manner attacks and defends all matters concerning life and death. Mars is a masculine malefic planet usually  regarded as dangerous but this is only of someone else's Mars. It is the ruler of Aries, the baby of the Zodiac, and Scorpio, the House of Death.
<br>
<br>Any action or activity is necessarily ruled by Mars. Whenever something is done, Mars is involved. The activity of Mars may be divided into two modes, building up and breaking down, both of which modify elements of the physical world. Mars is the manipulator of matter, productive and reproductive, creative and procreative. Raw materials are processed by the application of Martian force to produce a product and associated residual waste or by-products. The elimination of waste shows the Scorpionic side of Mars, burying in darkness.
<br>
<br>The cycles of Mars are primarily concerned with personal functions that ensure perpetuation. In effect, Martian action is for selfish ends.

<hr class="blank">

<h6>The Sun is the Reference for Three Cycles</h6>

The Sun is the prime source of our energy. As the largest and brightest phenomenon in the sky, it is not too surprising that many cultures have worshipped the Sun as the most important deity, the giver and sustainer of life. Without the warmth and light of the Sun life is unimaginable. It represents the life force that separates organic from inorganic, living from dead.
<br>
<br>The Solar principle in an individual radiates vitality and exuberance. The Sun in the birth chart shows the true essence of the personality, the core of the being. Its placement defines the quality of personal energy and the natural atmosphere in which it flows most freely. Cycles of the Sun show where energy flows. The influence on Venus is to encourage indulgence in life at its fullest. The most common craving that this causes is for consumption of food, the embodiment of the Sun's energy. The quality of food is the major factor that contributes to vitality. To Mercury is imparted the brightness of the mind. When the Sun's energy flows freely to Mercury the mind is alive, alert and agile. If energy is lacking the mental processes become slow and dull. Most important of all is the Sun Moon cycle. This is representative of the individual's response to life. Its effectiveness rests upon the condition of the Sun and Moon in the birth chart. This index of liveliness superimposed on the birth chart was known to ancient astrologers as the Part of Fortune.
<pre>
     CYCLE            FUNCTION                    EFFECT
     Sun Venus        Energetic desire            Appetite
     Sun Mercury      Energetic thought           Enthusiasm
     Sun Moon         Energetic response          Liveliness
</pre>


<hr class="blank">

<h6>Venus is the Reference for Two Cycles</h6>

Venus rules everything of beauty. The placement of Venus at birth indicates what is considered to possess this quality. The perception of Venusian beauty causes value judgments to be placed upon everything encountered. When something is considered to be of great value, desire to possess it increases. The possession of an object of desire is considered by the owner to be an achievement of gaining value. Therefore Venus not only rules the ephemeral beauty  of an object but also the wanting and having of it.
<br>
<br>
The passive nature of desire doesn't accommodate procurement of a valued object. Wanting doesn't necessarily lead to having. Venus influences Mercury and Moon, the only two smaller planets than Venus, to express the desire in the hope of fulfilment. The Venus Mercury cycle shows the way in which desire is communicated. This communication is two-way, as the perception of beauty and the declaration of desire. The Venus Moon cycle indicates the effect that a beautiful object has had on the beholder. The Venusian desire stirs the emotions in response to the valued object.
<br>
<br>
The function of desire is to improve the quality of life. This impulse is usually channelled into the acquisition of luxury as an expression of lifestyle beyond necessity. Happiness is so closely tied to this that personal well-being is often sacrificed to the attainment of status symbols. Strangely, this usually leads to the deterioration of health and inevitable estrangement from the only truly human happiness, vitality.

<hr class="blank">

<h6>Mercury is the Reference for Only One Cycle</h6>

Mercury is the smallest and fastest planet circling the Sun. Like Venus, its orbit is smaller than the Earth's so that from the Earth it never appears to be very far from the Sun. The longitudinal difference can be no greater than 28¬∞. Therefore, the Mercurial principle is never very far removed from the Solar. The Sun represents spirit and Mercury thought, and these two are inseparable. Mercury is traditionally dualistic, being neither male nor female although it rules a feminine sign, Virgo the Virgin and a masculine one, Gemini the Twins.
<br>
<br>
Mercurial thought has two functioning modes, input and output. Impressions are taken in via the senses and converted into ideas which are sometimes stored as memories. These ideas may be put out through the expression of speech and mannerism. Both require sensitivity provided by the Moon's interaction with Mercury. The Moon is the only planet smaller than Mercury and is directed by the Mercurial part of the mind to be sensitive to the environment and react to its stimulus. Without the emotional quality of the lunar principle the mind is dry and barren, rational and impartial. People who display these characteristics suppress the lunar part of the mind. On the other hand if the Moon is allowed to predominate, the mind becomes impressionable and unstable, lacking decisiveness and focus. Lunar sensitivity, response and habit, are not necessarily unstable. They are subconscious functions of the mind that depend entirely upon the role model, usually the mother, who taught this automatic behaviour primarily intended for self-preservation.

<h1 class="title t-center"><b>A Phase for Every Occasion</b></h1> 

<h6 class="title t-center">Twelve Issues for Twelve Phases</h6> 


<hr class="leaf">





This section is intended to assist in the recognition of the issues of phases. Once recognised a phase may be isolated from others that confuse situations. Phase frequencies make the issues complex but usually one in particular takes precedence. The information regarding the phase should be combined with the previous chapter's method for discovering the manifestation of the conditions in the real world, the substance of the matter in the world of elements.
<br>

<br>
Usually individual predicaments place emphasis on cause and effect. This displaces the attention away from the real issue. A cause shows as external factors but is truly described by the reference planet of a cycle. An effect is paralleled in the reaction or internalised factors of the person going through the motions or emotions reacting to the cause or situation.
<br>

<br>
These two facets of the problem are only the symptoms manifesting in the world. Seemingly there is no direct relationship or reason for the individual to be subjected to the particular cause. The uniting factor common to both cause and effect is represented by the cyclic relationship between the two planets which are intimately involved as the reference and the phase-maker. This is the phase.
<br>

<br>
The phase between two planets reveals the way in which a person uses one planet to discover the other. A reference planet is used to invoke, attract or find a representation of its principle that will in turn stimulate the function of the phase-making planet in the person. The aim is self-discovery but most often the result is distress and self-deception.
<br>

<hr class="h20">
<pre>
PHASE 1   SELF

Longitude: 000¬∞-030¬∞
    Ruler: Mars
   Gender: Masculine
     Mode: Attacking
  Element: Fiery
     Half: Waxing
 Quadrant: Inventive
    Range: Impulsive to Demanding
           Issues challenge personal identity
</pre>

The first phase uses aggression and assertion. The positive attributes of Mars are seeking expression through personal ability. The issue at stake is the validity of confidence. If the confidence is too great, the ability is obviously lower than claimed. Conversely, if confidence is lacking, unrealised potential prevails.
<br>

<br>
The need to do something in the world is urgent for everybody. Knowing what is possible and acting upon that knowledge is alien to humans. Instead, we stumble and jump through life in a constant guessing game of bluff and show. Attempts are made at performing feats that are sometimes possible but more often impossible.
<br>

<br>
Some people, especially those participating in the matters of the first phase, seem to prefer to give the impression of success rather than actually allowing their success to speak for them. These people are boisterous and use their loudness as a substitute for personal achievement. They gauge their effectiveness by the attention they can draw onto themselves. The ultimate aim of their reaction inducing activity is to incite a feeling of concern about them in others. Issues arise when those concerned people are concerned more about the noise than the person making it. The challenge being presented by the attentive audience is to finally come up with the goods. Great claims need great substantiation.
<br>

<br>
This is a difficult task for a show-off. Phase one is aimed at output and is not sensitive to anything other than the Self. Effectiveness runs parallel to the personal impression of personal expression. The concern is purely personal. If the phase one considers that the show is effective, then it is. This phase is waxing, so the showing-off will continue until either the desired concern rises, in which case there is no reason to stop, or until someone stops it from the outside. A couple of different things can happen at such a point. The most likely is that the phase one person will just go to another audience and start again. Otherwise a turnaround can occur by complaining of not being appreciated, loudly, to try to attract attention that way.
<br>

<br>
The favourite word for phase one'ers is I. Their next most favourite word is me All their other words are only used as a ploy to facilitate the use of their favourite words. They talk about the subject that is nearest and dearest to them, themselves. If some impertinent person manages to sway the talk onto something else, they will suddenly declare how it applies to them. And then they're back onto it. This is the start of where they become demanding. Usually, no matter how tolerant, understanding or suffering the audience, there is eventually the realisation that they might not be as deserving as they demand. People experiencing phase one confrontations need to accept, even if they can't realize, that their self-assertion is possibly too great, not too small, relative to personal achievement available through their other phases.
<br>

<hr class="h20">
<pre>
PHASE 2   POSSESSIONS

Longitude: 030¬∞-060¬∞
    Ruler: Venus
   Gender: Feminine
     Mode: Sustaining
  Element: Earthy
     Half: Waxing
 Quadrant: Inventive
    Range: Practical to Possessive
           Issues challenge personal values
</pre>

Phase two appears to have taken up the cudgel of achievement to compensate for the lack of it in phase one. Where this phase occurs there is the possibility of persistent desire for manifestation. Phase two wants something and will keep on wanting it until it gets it. And then it wants it more. Phase two likes having, just as much as wanting.
<br>

<br>
The feminine side of Venus, impressionable, sensitive and indulgent, underlines the desires that prevail in phase two. If the degree is fairly small the much sought after item might be made personally. This is the practical side of the issue coming out here. The person with this phase produces a concrete example of the cycle's function, in the real world, as its physical representation. The variety of objects is limited only by the nature of the material employed. Elemental earth prevails here. It could be art, artifact or artifice but somehow or other it is a manipulation of the raw materials available on the Earth.
<br>

<br>
As the degree increases through this phase the symbols are much more difficult to materialise. The obscurity of meaning that grows with the lack of experience of external examples of the subject matter is transferred onto implicit value of objects that are actually worth less. The person caught up in the value systems of phase two uses possessions to declare personal worth. Worthiness becomes a measured quantity and as a commodity may be owned by the holder. The issue that arises here is of personal worth achieved through personal deeds. There is an awareness that something should be done to attain personal worth but phase two, when habitually externalised, redirects value to the objects that are owned and away from the Self. The owner of a second phase, feeling that something needs to be done to increase personal value, does do something - buying it. But deeds can't be bought and no matter how much or how persistently this person keeps buying, the personal achievement remains the same.
<br>

<br>
The extreme case of the possession oriented person is the overindulgent one who becomes a living symbol of success. This is someone who wants to show the world all the personal success and value that has been achieved. Everything is rich. Rich food is eaten, rich clothes are worn and richness is the way of life. The issue that arises from this situation is two-fold. The first is that because the person has deviated from the necessary mode of living for a human existence, the lifestyle is outside normal restraints essential for well-being. Eventually the unhealthy negligence takes its toll on the body. This is true also for the displacement from social participation which leads to alienation. Secondly, personal significance, which was the primary aim, has not increased. In effect, after all the pursuit, the reality is no closer. The possessive phase two is still as insignificant, personally, as before. Personal possessions are being used as a substitute for personal fortitude. The lesson to be learnt is the necessity to build a personality rather than an empire.
<br>

<hr class="h20">
<pre>
PHASE 3   COMMUNICATION

Longitude: 060¬∞-090¬∞
    Ruler: Mercury
   Gender: Masculine
     Mode: Releasing
  Element: Airy
     Half: Waxing
 Quadrant: Inventive
    Range: Lighthearted to Superficial
           Issues challenge personal meaning
</pre>

Phase three overcomes the problem that phase two has of being weighed down by all those possessions. In fact it avoids anything at all that's weighty. This is the phase of surfaces, smooth, rough, charming or brusque. Whatever it looks like is probably all it is. It is as though phase three literally moves away from materialism. Anything natural or substantial is avoided.
<br>

<br>
Instead, there is a bubbling enthusiasm for the world of ideas. Especially to talk about them and talk and talk and talk. This is a releasing, airy phase and having released themselves from the burdens of the daily drive they find the next best way to release themselves is by airing their views. Wherever a phase three is found there will be the urge to communicate. Emphasis is placed more on the output side of communication as personal expression because phase three doesn't comprehend the two-way process. To them, the two sides of a conversation are the speaker and the listener but for them the roles never swap. They always assume the role of the speaker.
<br>

<br>
Even without a listener the positive side of Mercury still finds an outlet through writing. It seems there is always something to say no matter how it's said. The rather snappy style of phase three shows in Mercury's gossip. Information can go in one ear and out through the mouth -  or else at least onto paper. The problem is the lack of processing in between. Some proponents of this style may even argue, anything for another chance to chat, that information should be transmitted accurately. Apparently they just have to avoid any depth to the contents and processing thoughts would be very likely to add something like emotion, whatever that is, to it.
<br>

<br>
The attention of phase three is directed and redirected onto the next subject before any obligation to comprehend meaning could be required. The issue that is important to this phase is to think about ideas and not just transmit them. The most difficult task is to slow down. Slow down the speech, slow down the thoughts and slow down transition from one thought to the next. The nervous exchange stems from anxiety around being expected to understand what is being said. There is an apprehension about being asked what was meant. Mostly, the phase three patter is delivered free of meaning and the speaker doesn't want to get discovered as not knowing what it means.
<br>

<br>
When the issues rebound and turn towards criticism of the superficiality of phase three, there is an inclination to subterfuge. The slippery quality of Mercury is evident here as all sorts of excuses are made. Mercury just refuses to be pinned down. Phase three can usually talk itself out of any situation and failing all else take a turn of mind and deny all knowledge of the subject. Anything at all to get out of it. The problem is that problems don't go away like that. Running away from one problem will only run into the next. Only through understanding may problems be solved.

PHASE 4   HOME

Longitude: 090¬∞-120¬∞
    Ruler: Moon
   Gender: Feminine
     Mode: Attacking
  Element: Watery
     Half: Waxing
 Quadrant: Creative
    Range: Caring to Withdrawn
           Issues challenge personal position
</pre>

The multitude of things that so easily slipped through the hands of the third phase now fall into the clutch of the fourth phase. This is a protective phase that reverses the previous phase's superficiality by becoming emotionally involved with the world. There is an urge to grasp reality.
<br>

<br>
Fourth phase stakes territorial claims to declare home base. Whatever is considered to be home is vigilantly defended. This is an attacking phase yet it's sensitive at the same time. This flows in its watery element from the feminine and lunar principle that it represents. All important is the feeling of home and the security for which it stands.
<br>

<br>
When the degree of this phase is small, there is an easier grasp of the challenging issues. In effect the result is to care about the issue. The lunar response that follows the caring is more often than not irrational. It might be undue response, it might be unnecessarily too emotional, or else through the defensive stance grow a hard shell of resistance to negotiation.
<br>

<br>
If this isn't difficult enough, things really get out of hand as the degree increases. The tidal flow of the lunar depths of emotion start to overwhelm the person experiencing them through the phase issues. The waxing nature of phase four encourages this even more, so that when the tide rises, it surges. Waves come crashing on the shores of the subconscious Moon-ruled part of the mind. The roar of the surf deafens the conscious mind's ability to reason.
<br>

<br>
The result is an overflow of emotions into the issue whether they are wanted there or not. The emotions themselves become part of the issues, flowing through and around them. Once this has started the surging troubled waters can't be stopped until the Moon turns in its course. The waters will flow until they all flow out.
<br>

<br>
The new found vulnerability that arises from such a situation directs the defensive mechanism to withdrawal from the situation. Phase four turns in on itself like a crab hiding in its shell or retreating back to its hole. There it will wait for the tide to fall, however long that takes. The vulnerability combined with hypersensitivity causes injury to the soft sensitive disposition of the person swamped by big phase four issues. After the danger subsides, phase four is ever ready to go back out into the world a bit more jaded, a bit harder on the outside, and ever more cautious. The optimism of the waxing phase seems to endow an enthusiasm to try again. What has fallen will rise.
<br>

<br>
But it will fall again. The waxing of the Moon towards full always wanes away to the next cycle. The challenge to phase four is to realize the cyclic nature of sequential events and once this is accepted, it may be anticipated so that the surging power may be utilised rather than fought. Instead of feeling that the world is coming to an end, comfort may be found in knowing that it's just a phase.

PHASE 5   CREATIVITY

Longitude: 120¬∞-150¬∞
    Ruler: Sun
   Gender: Masculine
     Mode: Sustaining
  Element: Fiery
     Half: Waxing
 Quadrant: Creative
    Range: Demonstrative to Egoistic
           Issues challenge personal importance
</pre>

Phase five's courageous dynamism takes over from phase four's sensitive apprehension. The Sun as ruler seeks positive expression through this fiery phase. The masculine principle and waxing nature add combined emphasis to an already brilliant output.
<br>

<br>
The usual outlet for such a confident disposition is dramatic and theatrical. For phase five, flourishing gesticulation of pomp and pride commands an anticipating audience. Phase five expects to be and usually is at the centre of attention. The audience is expected to adore the subject and the adoration is acknowledged through the very act of attending.
<br>

<br>
Smaller degrees of this phase are more manageable for people who experience them through a cycle's issues. The roar of the lion of Leo, the sign associated with this phase, is usually sufficient to impress a crowd. This is the demonstrative end of the phase.
<br>

<br>
Towards the other end, with larger degrees and larger issues, the effects of the problems that can arise become more noticeable. Firstly, since this is a sustaining phase and also waxing, the fifth will keep on demonstrating the same thing in front of the same audience, then do it more and then again and again. To sustain the audience's attention as much as sustaining the show is much more difficult. The repertoire will need to be extended.
<br>

<br>
This raises another side of the same situation that occurs as an extreme at the other end of the scale of excitement. Fiery demonstrations can incite riots. An audience that becomes overexcited can get out of hand. This can even occur on a one-to-one basis where overenthusiastic behaviour coming from a phase five can provoke more reaction than anticipated. The commanding ability is put to test here, to learn that a cause has indeed an effect. Without an appreciation of this an action intended to stir attention might generate something more than just adoration.
<br>

<br>
The biggest issue of all for phase five involves the use of personal energy. If more energy is being put out than is being replenished then the organism, the generator of the energy, degenerates - the blood vessels dilate, the tissues constrict, the blood pressure rises and the heart fails. The heart, in astrology, is synonymous with the Sun, the ruler of the fifth. There is no need to turn an energetic fifth symphony into a truly dramatic experience.
<br>

<br>
Ultimately, the fifth phase encompasses the creative spark, the impulse and urge to put life into something. This potential could be creative or procreative. The offspring of a creative mind are the inventions of art. The art of inventiveness is the duplication of life. The germinating seed encapsulates the essence of the Sun's energy in concentrated form and the release of this energy is the sole purpose of the function of phase five.

PHASE 6   SERVICE

Longitude: 150¬∞-180¬∞
    Ruler: Mercury
   Gender: Feminine
     Mode: Releasing
  Element: Earthy
     Half: Waxing
 Quadrant: Creative
    Range: Attentive to Dissatisfied
           Issues challenge personal efficiency
</pre>

The concern of phase six is to develop the intention of potential encapsulated by phase five. This earthy phase needs to make a reality out of an idea, by means of method and efficiency. Phase six is the last of the waxing phases and is getting closer to opposition at the end of its last degree. The function of this phase is to manifest a realisation of the cycle's purpose.
<br>

<br>
At the beginning of the phase, in its smallest degrees, attentiveness is tantamount. The issue here is to examine the details of a situation by considering the prevailing conditions as contributing factors. Mercury, as ruler, releases the ideas as criticism of circumstance. If more is criticised than prevails phase six appears over-critical and so raises new issues for itself, to extend the criticism.
<br>

<br>
The loop that this can initiate is theoretically endless and is associated with a nervous disposition for the holder of a phase six issue. The result of this is an erosion of the health, yet another cause for concern. Instead of allowing such a condition to get out of hand, more attention should be directed towards self-assessment. This is on the waxing half and this means that the issues are actually only personal.
<br>

<br>
As the degrees increase through the phase, the phase-maker is achieving its greatest distance from the reference and the principles of the planets opposing each other grow increasingly disconnected. The biggest problem that can happen for a phase six is a feeling of displacement and lack of belonging. The pressing issues present the challenge for integration through comprehension of necessity.
<br>

<br>
Each of the phases is part of the whole and none is in isolation. Phase six is needing to learn a personal function within the system defined by the cycle. The issues that arise are around the unsuitability of collectivity to accommodate individuality. This leads to dissatisfaction and a feeling of insignificance and inefficacy whereby the person then feels unable to alter the situation.
<br>

<br>
When phase six issues climb to great heights the person is caught between a desperate condemnation of unreasonable conditions and a defeatist attitude regarding the necessity to manage and overcome the yet unscaled regions. There seems to be no turning back and no going forward. The reason this happens is that the phase-making planet, at the start, had been assumed to have skills that were absent and the person had assumed the issue of the reference planet to be something other than what it really was.
<br>

<br>
To resolve such a situation phase six needs to be more aware of the true circumstances of the situation by converting distress into skilful management. If criticism can be delivered then propensity for perfection must be already present and therefore what is expected to come from the outside may be achieved personally.

PHASE 7   RELATIONSHIP

Longitude: 180¬∞-210¬∞
    Ruler: Venus
   Gender: Masculine
     Mode: Attacking
  Element: Airy
     Half: Waning
 Quadrant: Expressive
    Range: Calm to Suffering
           Issues challenge impersonal interchange
</pre>

Phase seven is the first of the waning phases, the first to oppose another. In this case it opposes phase one. It starts to place personal issues into the context of an impersonal world. Phase one is only concerned about the immediacy of ego and self, but in phase seven the ego encounters issues that involve the weighing up of personal against impersonal qualities.
<br>

<br>
Like in phase six, the phase-maker is the most distant from the reference but where six feels the imposition, seven is urged to do something about it. The very nature of the seventh, attacking, expressive, masculine and waning, makes it very likely that someone with this phase can feel at odds with the function of the cycle and is being pressured to react.
<br>

<br>
The problem with having such a feeling arises when there is a lack of understanding of what the cycle means. This leads to indecisiveness about the way to deal with the situation. The externalisation of the principle of the reference planet shows most strongly in this phase as extreme dissociation from the individual being subjected to the issue. The usual expression of this is as a declaration of independence from the source of discomfort. The person firmly believes that the contention that impedes harmonious relationship is impersonal. The challenge is to discover what is in common as the basis of participation and what is not yet integrated as the cause for concern.
<br>

<br>
A small degree in this phase shows as a cool confidence that the situation won't get out of hand as long as it's not stirred up. The rulership of Venus is in evidence here as an active inactivity. The means by which this is achieved is to suppress the consciousness of the situation. This is an airy phase and the matter is purely in the airy realm of ideas. In the small degrees the small thoughts are easily kept under control.
<br>

<br>
When the degrees of the phase are higher, the thoughts are more urgent. The growing consciousness of the growing distress presents issues that can't be ignored. Depending upon the planets involved, the desperation that arises from these predicaments can drive a person to do what is seen to be the only possible thing to do. The situation that surrounds the desperation looks like me against the world as a victim of circumstances. During the build-up to the moment when something must be done about the urgent situation the phase seven person prepares the allies to believe that despite the good intention and efforts of the individual the situation unavoidably went beyond anybody's control. What is actually happening in these issues is that the phase seven person is trying to have an impossible relationship to test the personal ability to relate. The origin of the cause for concern was in the choice of the impossible partner to prove the difficulty of relationships. What needs to be learnt although much harder is to have a true relationship with true interchange.

PHASE 8   SECRETS

Longitude: 210¬∞-240¬∞
   Rulers: Mars and Pluto
   Gender: Feminine
     Mode: Sustaining
  Element: Watery
     Half: Waning
 Quadrant: Expressive
    Range: Discerning to Judgmental
           Issues challenge impersonal inherent value
</pre>

Phase eight is the natural progression from phase seven. Its intention is to intensify towards permanence by purging irrelevant material. This is the most challenging of all the phases as the Mars-rulership in its waning mode becomes relentless in carrying out its decisions. The element of water finds a way into or around anything and the sustaining nature of this phase combines into an extreme perseverance. The primary aim is to discover what is substantial and what is not.
<br>

<br>
The general approach to any situation surrounded by phase eight is one of mystery. Everything is regarded as a secret that must be revealed if it is false, yet maintained if it proves to be true. So phase eight carries a feeling of tension and apprehension through cautious circumspect in case falsehood becomes incidentally protected and truth accidentally revealed.
<br>

<br>
When the degrees in this phase are small, the management of the secrets is much easier and issues often allayed through discernment. The appraisal of the situation isn't necessarily accurate and doesn't need to be as long as intensity grows. Mystery surrounds the behaviour and circumstances of someone involved in the phase eight issues of a cycle. If it is proceeding then the right method is assumed to be in operation. If it is not going as expected, then any means possible will be used to get back onto it. Once the mind of a phase eight person is made up, no will not be taken as an answer. If something was thought to be possible, then it is possible. So if an apparent difficulty is encountered, only the means must be changed, not the ends.
<br>

<br>
As the degrees increase so do the intentions. A large phase eight issue expects a large return and large feats are performed to facilitate realisation. This in turn raises the chances of large obstructions or difficulties. When someone is embroiled in high stakes of passion in the pursuit of personal gain someone else stands to lose. Confrontation is expected as part of the game which is knowingly entered into and boldly emblazoned, at least to the phase eighter, with the motto may the best man win. Phase eight plays for high stakes and believes that whoever wins truly deserves the spoils. The problem with such an attitude is that judgments are made that may or may not prove to be reasonable. These judgments are placed upon associates who are forced into revealing whether they be friend or foe.
<br>

<br>
The issue truly at stake is the value of the worldly position of the individual. The competition is an attempt to denigrate another to elevate the self. The positive expression of this issue is to achieve self-transformation, like the butterfly from the grub. There is a potential regeneration in this phase that is unlike anything possible in any other. When this is negated, especially in people with high frequencies of phase eight, we find them set in their ways, maintaining their material conquests. But the dissatisfaction in them can't remain a secret.

PHASE 9   ADVENTURE

Longitude: 240¬∞-270¬∞
    Ruler: Jupiter
   Gender: Masculine
     Mode: Releasing
  Element: Fiery
     Half: Waning
 Quadrant: Expressive
    Range: Liberal to Careless
           Issues challenge impersonal aims
</pre>

Phase nine is the thrill-seeker, daring to go where no-one has gone before, just for the sake of it. It's as though phase nine just goes off to get away from all the intensity and heaviness of phase eight. This is the phase that urges holidays and Jupiterian travels far away to other lands. It doesn't really matter if the places are crowded, as long as the phase nine experience is new.
<br>

<br>
Adventurous experiences can be had in many fields. The range of pursuits encompassed by phase nine is rather broad, from physical to mental. It covers anything not absolutely necessary but nevertheless regarded as important because of the new territory that is ventured into. In fact, when the excitement becomes familiar, the adventure is no longer of interest and is simply too ordinary, that is, compared to the next.
<br>

<br>
The optimism of Jupiter is in great abundance in phase nine. All the way from the low degrees through to the highest, peril, difficulty and danger are seen more as reasons to continue than as setbacks. Phase niners bear with them the motto ‚ÄòIt's just an adventure - there's no need to take it personally‚Äô. They never see a need to turn back. Once the fire is released through phase nine, Jupiter keeps it going.
<br>

<br>
These challenges to phase nine, that are so happily ignored, are trying to inform the person experiencing them that a transgression has been made. The new adventure is new for the adventurer but not for the ones who are already there. Not all explorers are welcomed with open arms and accredited for the conquest that is anticipated. From the other side, the explorer is seen as an invader. The challenges are defensive. They are not intended as encouragement. Phase nine is actually being told that there is really no such thing as unchartered lands, there is no uninhabited island.
<br>

<br>
Phase nine re-invents the wheel, preaches to the converted and states the very obvious. The real challenge in the issues of this phase is consciousness. The situation that surrounds someone experiencing phase nine in a particular cycle is best described as a consciousness crisis. Yet even this is not taken personally. The crisis is experienced more by the people around the phased person.
<br>

<br>
Eventually the suppression of consciousness becomes increasingly difficult. The dare or die attitude that tries to have more and more adventures results in a greater aversion to realisation. The challenges presented along the way were trying to inform the phase niner that alienation is being encountered. The individual is becoming alienated from the Self. The initial intention of the searching for phase nine is to discover functional identity. This is another fire phase, like one and five, and the issue is again about the ego. This time, the concern is on the impersonal waning side of the cycle which indicates that the ego is searching for its place in the world - a meaning in life. This is achieved through anticipating the meaning in experience.

PHASE 10  PUBLIC

Longitude: 270¬∞-300¬∞
    Ruler: Saturn
   Gender: Feminine
     Mode: Attacking
  Element: Earthy
     Half: Waning
 Quadrant: Effective
    Range: Ambitious to Ruthless
           Issues challenge impersonal position
</pre>

Phase ten takes a turnaround from phase nine. Attention is directed entirely to the outside circumstances. This is outward projection at its strongest. The problem is that the individual identifies with the externalised manifestation, believing that the impersonal world is analogous to identity.
<br>

<br>
The smaller degrees in this phase characterise the ambitious nature that represents an attack on the world because the phase's mode is an attacking one. Paradoxically the phase is extremely sensitive through feminine earth. The way in which this is reconciled is by claiming that a stake in the world is necessary for survival. The aggressive assault on the world to fulfil the ambition stems from a feeling of insecurity which is really a lack of structure in personal organisation. The struggle turns into a fight when the competition is seen to be getting there first.
<br>

<br>
This is the first phase of the fourth quadrant of the cycle and is associated with much broader and more general concerns of the impersonal world. It represents the public sphere of the collective masses of people. Its challenge is to find a place in that world. The very realisation of the necessity for this position reveals the anxiety factor for phase ten.
<br>

<br>
When the issues are seen to be fairly manageable, in the smaller degrees of the phase, the anxiety also seems manageable at the same time. With a smaller range of competitors and a smaller stake required, the confidence overcomes the fear and appears as business acumen. This confidence can lead to a false sense of security as the phase ten person ventures into a myriad of circumstances, all relatively small, but collectively large, that eventually raise the stress level above the manageable threshold. This happens because each concern in the world demands a piece of the person to be taken away from personal control. The personality becomes injected into the various pursuits. This in turn depletes personal energy and scatters the ability to maintain resistance to the unexpected. Personal integrity is at stake. The only solution to this problem is re-integration - bringing back into the self all the dissipated energies. Phase ten needs to realise that a person has more effectiveness when complete. The simple spreading of the personality over a large area in the world does not make a greater individual.
<br>

<br>
The larger degrees of phase ten reveal the rulership of Saturn. People who have issues in these degrees often show the negative side of Saturnian principles. The sobriety is claimed to be the result of the frustration caused by external circumstances beyond the scope of the individual. In a way, this is indeed the case, because the individual is being challenged to have a serious concern about the function of the cycle in which the phase is found. The reference planet, although being seen as the cause of the situation, is also demanding through Saturn a more efficient representation of its principle.

PHASE 11  SOCIETY

Longitude: 300¬∞-330¬∞
   Rulers: Saturn and Uranus
   Gender: Masculine
     Mode: Sustaining
  Element: Airy
     Half: Waning
 Quadrant: Effective
    Range: Humanitarian to Detached
           Issues challenge impersonal attitudes
</pre>

Phase eleven, being airy, has a lighter attitude towards the world than phase ten. Its interests are around the social function of the populace rather than the mere collectivity. Here the competitiveness of phase ten is regarded as a reason to motivate social interchange to alleviate discord. The eleventh phase attempts impartiality to effect and sustain an impersonal world.
<br>

<br>
The major cause for concern for a person involved in phase eleven issues is fitting in. The individual has rather distinct attitudes about how society should be and could be. Although the idealistic view may be better than what is current the individual who holds it is actually already being of the new order and therefore not fitting into the present reality. The striving for integration via the anticipated process actually causes the individual to be not normal in the old-fashioned way. This causes great anxiety because the intention is to fit in but the result is the opposite. Even if the new order comes in, the phase eleven person is already onto the next stage and is still out of step.
<br>

<br>
The expectation of the new is the Uranian side of the phase but the frustration caused by the Saturnian rulership shows in the impatience of the person who can't believe that the world is so slow to change. All this leads to a struggle for normality in the current world and a compounded feeling of anxiety for the next. The particular planets involved in the cycle play a vital role in the significance of this phase through their sympathy or antipathy to the cause.
<br>

<br>
If the degrees are large then the desperation is equally large whereby the frustration overwhelms anticipation. The issue seems so large that the individual begins to think that the personal view is so insignificant that achievement of goals is impossible. If the degrees are small and the source of frustration believed to be locatable, the person voluntarily becomes the agent of change as a humanitarian worker.
<br>

<br>
The worker with a social intent is trying to manifest a new world where all people have an appropriate place. The true motivation for this seemingly selfless act is a reversal of the need for someone else to assist the individual personally with integration into the function of the cycle in which the phase is activated. The distress arises from the issues in the impersonal world when all the help that is being given out is not being returned. No-one who receives the help ever realises that the person who is helping is probably in greater need.
<br>

<br>
The key to the solution is in the guilt that surrounds the consciousness of the eleventh phaser. The person feels that there is no real reason to feel worse off than others, especially when surrounded by carefully chosen people whose predicaments are obviously worse. There is no more appropriate saying to be offered to phase eleven than ‚ÄòGod helps those who help themselves‚Äô.

PHASE 12  INSTITUTION

Longitude: 330¬∞-360¬∞
   Rulers: Jupiter and Neptune
   Gender: Feminine
     Mode: Releasing
  Element: Watery
     Half: Waning
 Quadrant: Effective
    Range: Reverent to Fearful
           Issues challenge impersonal faith
</pre>

Phase twelve is anxiety plus. There is an over-concern about the world in all its magnitude as if it is just too big to comprehend. The issues manifested by phase twelve, even in the lowest degrees, are always unimaginable in proportion. Actually, this is due to the combined influence of Jupiter and Neptune in a feminine watery releasing waning phase which produces mental images of outstanding dimensions.
<br>

<br>
There is a sense of awe in the mind of a person experiencing phase twelve. To other people, there is little outward sign to indicate the turbulent confusion inside. The smaller degrees almost allow this feeling to be acceptable when channelled into awe-inspiring religious pursuits. When this is avoided, there is no conditional framework in which to place the experiences.
<br>

<br>
The larger degrees of this phase are heading towards the end of the cycle at the next conjunction that the phase-maker forms to its reference. The implication of the anxiety surrounding this may be paralleled to a feeling of returning to the source. It is likely that many people would try to avoid any commitment for as long as possible in their lives regarding the manifestation of this issue. The challenge that is being experienced may be best described as cosmic pressure. This raises the question of cosmic identity for the individual. How the individual sees eternity will play the most important role in the function of the issues. If there is a personal comprehension of religious experience, a belief in God and faith in the relationship between God and the individual, there is a ready-made form of expression already in existence in the world to assist in the realisation of the issues that may arise.
<br>

<br>
The problems that can arise within any religious framework come from surrendering personal liability. There is a belief in belief whereby the person expects if religious instruction is followed, salvation will also. There follows the surrender of personal interests through self-sacrifice and self-imposed martyrdom. The individual can turn denial of the self into ridiculous proportions.
<br>

<br>
When religiosity is not acceptable and an alternative of equal comprehensibility has not been found, fear of the unknown in unimaginable proportions rushes over the individual. The result of manifesting unseen and unknown forces in the world can and probably will crush the person. Fear can be the person's own worst enemy.
<br>

<br>
Yet fear is just the complement of faith and the twelfth is simply challenging the person's ability to have faith - to grasp reality as it is. The distortion caused by inaccurately perceiving the reality of situations is the prime source of the plight of humankind. The small snippet of our subjective view through the thin slit of our limited window onto the world should never be mistaken to show the complete picture.

The Jupiter-Saturn cycle is not only of great historical importance, it is also the most significant for events or individuals. Jupiter strives to make its mark on the planet while Saturn seems to go out of its way to ensure that won't happen. Because these are the largest planets, the major issues here are the difficulty of becoming or growing into that which should be, and also  structuring and maintaining that which was possible. The tendency to operate within the realm of the previous phase is even greater than with the other cycles.

It's all about me.<br>
Cardinal, fiery and ruled by the brighter side of Mars, this is an energetic and enthusiastic phase. Usually single minded, there is a strong tendency to make a name for oneself. That is far more important than to what that name might be attached but the achievement will also be well remembered like a Ford car or a Dylan song. Important, most of all, was to establish something new, the start of that which was not there before. Whether it be Isaac Newton's first law of motion, Henry Ford's first mass produced car, Pablo Picasso's abstract art, or Jack Kerouac's Stream of consciousness (very Hermetic), there is no doubt these people are cultural pioneers. Like all phases, the source material lies in the realm of the previous phase, in this case Phase Twelve, so it should come as no surprise that Isaac Newton was a keen alchemist. John Lennon and Paul McCartney managed to create something new out of their vast musical knowledge and skills of what their predecessors had already achieved. Immanuel Kant managed to establish modern philosophy, yet only because of his particularly rational treatment of an  immense knowledge of what had been before.

There's More to Life Than This<br>
Wherever this phase is found there will be an enrichment created by a true artist at work. Perhaps a flourish, or some depth or drama, but there will surely be that something extra to make the experience more worth while. Most people who have heard the masterpieces of J. S. Bach will agree that he managed to turn music into a religious experience. The lavish brush strokes and use of colours in a Rembrandt painting are larger than life, leaving lasting impressions. The gripped tone and turn in the words of Kafka or Nietzsche have resonated with generations of readers. One can be sure the same be said of George Harrison's unexpected classics. Speaking of classics, where would the world be without Grimm's Fairy Tales, the product of an untiring effort from Jacob Grimm and his brother Wilhelm? When Curly Howard joined his brothers in The Three Stooges his elaborate improvisations were the very nature of their success. Archie Leach in a similar fashion reinvented himself as the actor Cary Grant, equally offstage as on, to become the Hollywood Icon for which he was famous.

All the people listed to the right with Jupiter-Saturn in Phase Three have something fundametally in common. Story-telling. Their predisposition and achievements all revolve around the importance and success of a good story. This is not particularly random or simply good luck, for every story requires the personal Logos which is inherently connected and tapped into the Divine Logos for it to come together and be brought across. The effect of words upon the human mind has a long history of much overlooked power. The words used to describe magic at work, such as "spell" or "conjure" encapsulate the method. Ancient Druids were renowned for their special powers of speech and hearing, able to transcend time and space, in exactly the same manner as Hermes Trismegistus is mentioned to be doing in the Hermetic texts. The Norse God Odin had his Ravens tell him things. All of the most ancient traditions relied upon myths, sagas and legends being told to inspire and educate generation after generation. Legend has it that both Hermes and Thoth, as well as their amalgamation into Hermes Trismegistus, all invented and brought language into the world. These people enrapture their audiences by bringing an otherwise unknown world to those in need of it.

Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practitioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
