<h1 class="title"><span>Cycles and Phases in Hermetical Astrology</span></h1>

One of the most important facets of hermetic astrology, which has been maintained in all astrology ever since,  is that of the comparison of planetary positions relative to each other. Viewed from our planet Earth, the sun takes one calendar year to complete it's cycle in a great circular path known as the ecliptic.<br>
<br>
The other planets travel close to that same path in a greater or lesser time. The ecliptic itself lies amidst a background of fixed, non-moving, stars and is divided into twelve sections or constellations, known as the signs of the zodiac. Astronomically, in service to that, a flat celestial plane is circumferenced by the ecliptic with the earth lying at its centre.<br>
<br>
Another celestial plane extends into the cosmos out from the plane of the earth's equator. Since he ecliptic and the celestial equator lie at an angle of about 23 degrees to each they only intersect at two points. One marks the start of the ecliptic at zero degrées of the first sign of the zodiac. The other is directly opposite, separated by 180 degrees at zero degrees of Libra.<br>
<br>
The time taken by each planetary body to return to any specified point on the ecliptic is known as its Sidereal Period, literally meaning its time to travel through the starry constellations. The Moon, Mercury and Venus, known as the inner planets, are faster than the sun and therefore they take less than one year. The outer planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn take longer than a year.<br>
<br>
The Ecliptic<br>
The apparent path of the Sun around the earth as seen from the earth, against the backdrop of fixed stars often called the zodiac <br>
<br>
The Zodiac<br>
From the Greek word zōon, meaning that which can move itself, such as animal. The signs of the zodiac are often taken to be the animals but it actually refers to the planets being able to move themselves.<br>
<br>
Sidereal Period <br>
The time taken for a planet to return to the same point on the ecliptic.<br>
<br>
Planetary 	Sidereal Periods<br>
Moon - 1 day<br>
Mercury	- 88 days<br>
Venus - 	225 days<br>
Sun 	-	1 year<br>
Mars - 1.9 years<br>
Jupiter - 11.9 years<br>
Saturn - 29.5 years<br>
<br>
Although not hermetic, the more recently discovered planets are given here for comparison<br>
Uranus -	84.0 years<br>
Neptune	- 164.8 years<br>
Pluto - 248.5 years<br>
<br>
Sometimes planets can be extremely close to each other on the ecliptic and when this happens it is called a conjunction. In modern astrology, it is known as an aspect of conjunction and there are many other aspects such as opposition, meaning most distant from each other. In ancient times though, the Hermetic system used a twelfth of the ecliptic to describe the separation. Each twelfth of the 360 degrees of the ecliptic is therefore 30 degrees, which also the size of each zodiacal sign.<br>
<br>
Older texts use the Greek work phasein to denote how many 30 degree sections apart the planets are to be found in an astrological configuration drawn up as a chart. More modern translations and adaptations prefer sometimes to call them houses but that term has many different meanings. <br>
<br>
So, say for instance, Jupiter and Saturn happen to be separated by 100 degrees along the ecliptic, and Jupiter is ahead of Saturn, the configuration would be described as Jupiter in Saturn's fourth house or phase. This type of reckoning is distinctly part of Mesopotamian and Babylonian celestial divination of the Chaldean period, having been absorbed at the foundation of hermetic astrology.<br>
<br>
In that ancient world, the study of these cycles, especially of Jupiter and Saturn, was employed to predict the fates and affairs of nations and their leaders. It was the Greek adaptation that turned it into the Astrology we know today. That also made way for all of the planets to be utilised in such a manner.<br>
<br>
Bearing all this in mind, it was the combined Greek and Egyptian contribution that systemized the celestial influences coming from the zodiac. The twelve signs impart twelve distinct characters upon the planets which pass through them.<br>

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is routed in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
