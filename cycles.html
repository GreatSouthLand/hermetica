<p>17 Hermetical Axioms</p>

<b>Astronomy</b>
<br><br>
Astronomy is a science which concerns itself over using mathematical equations to determine the positions of the planets. Especially towards the end of the twentieth century with the advent of the computer, highly accurate predictions can be made.
<br>
<br>
This is rather ironic because it is the science making the prediction about that which has not happened, not Astrology. The planetary positions thus calculated enable Astrology to produce highly accurate results for more reliable interpretations.
<br>
<br>
To perform Cycle and Phase calculations for any particular point in time, it is therefore only necessary to have a program that will generate the necessary data. Traditionally the results of positional calculations were drawn up in tables called ephemerides. That is no longer necessary and the position of any two planets involved in a cycle may be quickly caclulated and the relationship determined.

<h1 class="title"><span>Cycles and Phases in Hermetical Astrology</span></h1>

One of the most important facets of Hermetic Astrology, which has been maintained in all branches of astrology ever since, is that of the comparison of planetary positions relative to each other. This was inherited from the Babylonian Study of the Great Conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn which were based upon celestial observations and predictions about where those planets would be at any particular date.

<p>The Star Signs of The Zodiac</p>
</div>

<br>


<h5>The Zodiac and The Planets </h5>


The entire system of astrology is based upon the apparent path of the Sun as seen from Earth which completes a full circle of 360 degrees in one year. This circle passes through twelve constellations named collectively as the Zodiac from the Greek word z≈çon, meaning that which can move itself, such as animals. The signs of the zodiac are often taken to be the animals but it actually refers to the planets being able to move themselves. Each Sign of the Zodiac spans thirty degrees of the ecliptic. All the other planets travel close to the path of the ecliptic taking a greater or lesser time to circle the Earth.

The Ecliptic - Path of the Sun
<p>
Viewed from the Earth, the sun takes one calendar year to complete its cycle in a great circular path known as the ecliptic which is divided into the twelve signs of the zodiac. It's called the ecliptic because it is where eclipses occur.

<b>Sidereal Period</b>
<br><br>
The time taken for a planet to return to the same point on the ecliptic.
<br><br>
Planetary Sidereal Periods<br>
Moon - 1 day<br>
Mercury	- 88 days<br>
Venus - 	225 days<br>
Sun 	-	1 year<br>
Mars - 1.9 years<br>
Jupiter - 11.9 years<br>
Saturn - 29.5 years<br>
<br>
Although not hermetic, the more recently discovered planets are given here for comparison<br>
Uranus -	84.0 years<br>
Neptune	- 164.8 years<br>
Pluto - 248.5 years<br>
</div>

<br>

The start of the Zodiac is at the intersection of the ecliptic with another celestial plane which extends out from the plane of the earth's equator. Since the ecliptic and the celestial equator lie at an angle of about 23 degrees to each they only intersect at two points. One marks the start of the ecliptic at zero degrees of Aries, the first sign of the zodiac. The other is directly opposite, separated by 180 degrees at zero degrees of Libra.

The Planets - Moving Celestial Bodies
<p>
The word planet is derived from an ancient Greek word meaning wanderer. All seven of the planets, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn can be observed to move through the zodiac, not far from the ecliptic. 
</p>
</div>
<br>

<h5>Revolution - The Sidereal Period</h5>

The time taken by each planetary body to complete one revolution by returning to any specified point on the ecliptic is known as its Sidereal Period, literally meaning its time to travel through the starry constellations. The Moon, Mercury and Venus, known as the inner planets, are faster than the sun and therefore they take less than one year. The outer planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn take longer than a year.
<br>

<h5>Cycles and Phases</h5>


Sometimes planets can be extremely close to each other on the ecliptic and when this happens it is called a conjunction. In modern astrology, it is known as an aspect of conjunction and there are many other aspects such as an opposition, meaning most distant from each other. In ancient times though, the Hermetic system used a twelfth of the ecliptic to describe the separation. Each twelfth of the 360 degrees of the ecliptic is therefore 30 degrees, which is also the size of each zodiacal sign.
<br>
<br>
Older texts use the word phase (phasein in Greek) to denote how many 30 degree sections apart the planets are to be found in an astrological configuration drawn up as a chart. More modern translations and adaptations prefer sometimes to call them houses but that term has many different meanings. <br>
<br>
So, say for instance, Jupiter and Saturn happen to be separated by 100 degrees along the ecliptic, and Jupiter is ahead of Saturn, the configuration would be described as Jupiter in Saturn's fourth house or phase. This type of reckoning is distinctly part of Mesopotamian and Babylonian celestial divination of the Chaldean period, having been absorbed at the foundation of hermetic astrology.
<br>
<br>
In that ancient world, the study of these cycles, especially of Jupiter and Saturn, was employed to predict the fates and affairs of nations and their leaders. It was the Greek adaptation that turned it into the Astrology we know today. That also made way for all of the planets to be utilised in such a manner. Bearing all this in mind, it was the combined Greek and Egyptian contribution that systemized the celestial influences coming from the zodiac. The twelve signs impart twelve distinct characters upon the planets which pass through them.

The Phases of the Moon
<p>
Everyone is familiar with the phases of the moon. While forming phases to the sun, the moon shows different views according to how far apart along the ecliptic these two planets are during the course of the month. At the time of conjunction, when they are closest together in the same degree of the ecliptic, it is called a new moon. At that time they are also together at the same degree of the same zodiacal sign. The moment the moon joins the sun, it is in phase one to the sun, which lasts until it is thirty degrees away at phase two. At full moon, it is in opposition to the sun, so that they are six zodiacal signs apart at phase seven.
</p>
</div>

<h5>The Phases of All The Cycles</h5>

With a total of seven planets, there are altogether twenty-one possible cycles. Each of these cycles has a particular meaning and the two planets involved in each cycle, and their signs, all have a particular character.

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is routed in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
