<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and like many others, I am the descendant of Australian immigrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of Queensland and New South Wales in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world. The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a "New World" portrays a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.<br><br>
Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
