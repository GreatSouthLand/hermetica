<h1 class="title"><span>Daimons in Hermetical Astrology</span></h1>

One of the most Hermetic areas of interest in Astrology lies within the field of <i>Planetary Daimons</i> for they are fundamental to both the Technical and Philosophical Hermetic literature. In ancient Greece, <i>Daimons</i> were placed somewhere between the Divine and the Natural, in effect being regarded as half-gods or demi-gods.
<br><br>

The word <i>daimōn</i> (Ancient Greek: δαίμων) denotes negative or positive planetary energy (energeia, actuality) or force (dynamis, potentiality). It is also characteristic of particular places derived from planetary positions in an astrological chart, as well as being attached to certain houses, namely the 5th and the 11th. 
<br><br>

In Hermetic Philosophy, a person's Good Daimon (<i>eudaimon</i> or <i>agathos daimon</i>), is a guiding spirit, which accompanies the soul to its earthly incarnation, stays with it throughout life and finally escorts it back to the outer spheres upon death. In Latin, that Daimon is known as a person's <i>Genius</i>, and in theology as a <i>Guardian Angel.</i> These ideas were prominent in early philosophy such as that of Plato (c.427–348 BC).

Extremely ancient horoscopes have recently surfaced due to the hard work of diligent historians piecing together fragments of manuscripts from various locations, previously thought to be unrelated. These charts contain delineations in a similar manner to modern astrology and place the great importance on the calculable daimons and their meaning.
<br><br>

There are a few linguistic or technical difficulties which arise with the use of the word <i>daimon</i>. Firstly, according to the Hermetic texts, everyone has a personal daimon accompanying the soul from the cosmos into the body at birth and again away from the body back to the cosmos after death. This daimon is sometimes found astrologically. But according to the gnostic version, the departed soul of an enlightened being is accompanied by the daimon of each planetary sphere upon reaching that level on its way out of the physical realm. So, in that gnostic version what happens to the personal daimon during the ascent? Does it clash with the planetary daimon?
<br><br>

Secondly, the word <i>daimon</i> is not only the name of a particular calculable "lot" or "fate" in an astrological chart, it is also the name used for all of the lots or fates. Therefore the lot of the sun, the part of spirit, should be known as the "daimon of daimon". Likewise, the lot of the moon, the part of fortune, should really be the "daimon of tyche". As well as that, the last two astrological houses are also called daimon. So it is rather difficult to keep these frames of reference apart, especially if a Hermetic practitioner wished to include all of these in a chart.
<br><br>

There is a third problem and that is with the word <i>"demon"</i>,  derived from <i>daimon</i>. "The term [demon} had first acquired its negative connotations in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, which drew on the mythology of ancient Semitic religions" (wikipedia). This occurred around the 3rd century BCE when Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–247 BCE) requested seventy-two Hebrew translators, supposedly six from each of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, perform the translation. At that time there was also a lot of attention paid by these scholars to gnosticism with its view of a world filled with evil. This dualistic notion had been carried over from Zoroastrianism by those same semitic scholars. Undoubtedly these ideas later formed the foundation for Christianity which inherited those evil demons, holus-bolus.

<h6>Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche</h6>

In the ancient Greek world there is a lot of mythology surrounding our subject. <i>Agathos Daimon</i> (Greek: ἀγαθός δαίμων), sometimes Agathodaimon, meaning "noble spirit" often appeared with his spouse or companion, <i>Agathe Tyche</i> (Greek: Ἀγαθὴ Τύχη), "good fortune". As early as the 5th C. BCE, Agathos Daimon was depicted as a snake and remained popular as a protective spirit for personal houses, and to which ritual offerings were made following every meal. As has been pointed out by some historians, this probably had a practical nature with snakes being known to destroy vermin.
<br><br>

In Ptolemaic Egypt (305-30 BCE), Agathos Daimon was the guardian of Alexandria and equated with Shai, the ancient Egyptian god of destiny, also depicted as a snake. In Greco-Roman Egypt (332 BCE - 395 CE), these two figures, Agathos Daimon and Shai were merged into the primordial snake called Kneph. 



The Graeco-Egyptian god, Serapis, popularised in the 3rd C. BCE by orders of the Greek Pharaoh Ptolomy was often depicted as having a male Greek looking head and the body of a snake. This successfully shifted attention away from Egyptian gods and onto the Greek, and bizarrely absorbed into the god <i>"Serapis Amun Agathodaemon"</i>.
<br><br>

Traditionally <i>daimon</i> is taken to mean spirit while <i>tyche</i> as fortune or luck. 
<br><br>

The word <i>daimon</i>, like <i>dynamis</i> can mean force or potential, or what could be, as opposed to the domain of <i>energeia</i> or <i>tyche</i> as fortune and what already has happened to be. 
<!--DGG p102-->
<br><br>

In Hermetic Astrology, the 11th "house" (twelfth of the ecliptic) is known as the <i>Good Spirit (agathos daimon)</i> and the 12th "house" as the <i>Bad Spirit (kaka daimon)</i>. Similarly, the 5th "house" is known as <i>Good Fortune (agathos tyche)</i> and the 6th "house" as <i>Bad Fortune (kaka tyche)</i>. These are used extensively in birth charts to determine the destiny of the native. In medical astrology they assist with the prognosis and outcome of an illness.

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practitioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
