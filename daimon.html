<h5>Working with Daimons</h5>

The most hermetic part of hermetic astrology must lie within that of the planetary daimons for they are fundamental to both the technical and philosophical hermetic literature.<br>
<br>
The word daimōn (Δαίμων / δαίμων) was used to describe negative or positive planetary energy or force as well as being a characteristic of places relating to planetary positions in an astrological chart. Extremely ancient horoscopes have recently surfaced due the hard work of diligent historians piecing together fragments of manuscripts previously thought to be unrelated.<br>
<br>
These charts contain delineations in a similar manner to modern astrology but place the greatest influence to that of calculable daimons.<br>

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and just like many others, I am a descendant of Australian immigrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of Queensland and New South Wales in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
<br><br>
One and a half centuries later, the collectable information available to recreate
a realistic picture of these people is not altogether detailed or consistent. Yet there are
still many traces remaining that we have managed to gather together here.
<br><br>
<strong>A family history</strong> such as this is obviously full of impressions and opinions
laced together with as much historical information as is available but telling the complete story or stories still remains to be seen. Very often only scant real information is available. <br>
We are very grateful to those people who have already put in a lot of effort, especially for
making records, articles and memorials available and to anyone interested in reading this <strong>so here's a hearty thanks!</strong>
<br><br>
Comments and contributions are always welcome.
