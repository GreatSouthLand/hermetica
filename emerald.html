<h1 class="title"><span>The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus</span></h1>

As legend has it, a cornerstone of hermetic wisdom is embodied by an emerald stone tablet covered with inscriptions outlining details of principles held high.<br>
<br>
Until the early 20th century, only Latin versions of the Emerald Tablet were known, with the oldest dating back to the 12th century. The first Arabic versions were rediscovered by the English historian of science E.J. Holmyard (1891-1959) and the German orientalist Julius Ruska (1867-1949). (Wikipedia)<br>

<i>
True it is, without falsehood, certain and most true. 
That which is above is like to that which is below, 
and that which is below is like to that which is above, 
to accomplish the miracles of one thing. So all things 
And as all things were by contemplation of one, 
arose from this one thing by a single act of adaptation.
The father thereof is the Sun, the mother the Moon. 
The wind carried it in its womb, the earth is the nurse thereof. 
It is the father of all works of wonder throughout the whole world. 
The power thereof is perfect. If it be cast on to earth, 
it will separate the element of earth from that of fire, 
the subtle from the gross. 
With great sagacity it doth ascend gently from earth to heaven. 
Again it doth descend to earth, and uniteth in itself the force 
from things superior and things inferior. 
Thus thou wilt possess the glory of the brightness of the whole world, 
and all obscurity will fly far from thee. 
This thing is the strong fortitude of all strength, for it overcometh 
every subtle thing and doth penetrate every solid substance. 
Thus was this world created. 
Hence will there be marvellous adaptations achieved, of which the manner is this. 
For this reason I am called Hermes Trismegistus, 
because I hold three parts of the wisdom of the whole world. 
That which I had to say about the operation of Sol is completed.

Truth! Certainty! That in which there is no doubt!<br>
That which is above is from that which is below, and that which is below is from that which is above,<br>
working the miracles of one [thing]. As all things were from One.<br>
Its father is the Sun and its mother the Moon.<br>
The Earth carried it in her belly, and the Wind nourished it in her belly,<br>
as Earth which shall become Fire.<br>
Feed the Earth from that which is subtle,<br>
with the greatest power. It ascends from the earth to the heaven<br>
and becomes ruler over that which is above and that which is below.<br>
—Zirnis 1979, p. 90. 	—Holmyard 1923. <br>
<br>
As above, so below<br>
That which is above is from that which is below, and that which is below is from that which is above. <br>
<br>
Arabic: إن الأعلى من الأسفل والأسفل من الأعلى (Inna al-aʿlā min al-asfal wa-l-asfal min al-aʿlā) <br>
<br>
English translation from Latin of the Entire Text of the Emerald Tablet by Isaac Newton<br>
<br>
Tis true without lying, certain and most true. That which is below is like that which is above and that which is above is like that which is below to do the miracle of one only thing. And as all things have been and arose from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation. The Sun is its father, the moon its mother, the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth is its nurse. The father of all perfection in the whole world is here. Its force or power is entire if it be converted into earth. Separate thou the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross sweetly with great industry. It ascends from the earth to the heaven and again it descends to the earth and receives the force of things superior and inferior. By this means you shall have the glory of the whole world and thereby all obscurity shall fly from you. Its force is above all force, for it vanquishes every subtle thing and penetrates every solid thing. So was the world created. From this are and do come admirable adaptations where of the means is here in this. Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world. That which I have said of the operation of the Sun is accomplished and ended.<br>
<br>
From the late 16th century onwards, the Emerald Tablet is often accompanied by a symbolic figure called the Tabula Smaragdina Hermetis. (Wikipedia)<br>

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is routed in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
