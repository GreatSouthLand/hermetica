The Four Levels of Identity are <br>
derived from the signs and their <br>
elements.<br>
<br>
Firstly, here are the signs in order <br>
around the zodiac, with associated  <br>
element, polarity and ruler:<br>
<br>
12. Pisces      water -ve Jupiter<br>
11. Aquarius    air   +ve Saturn<br>
10. Capricorn   earth -ve Saturn<br>
 9. Sagittarius fire  +ve Jupiter<br>
 8. Scorpio     water -ve Mars<br>
 7. Libra       air   +ve Venus<br>
 6. Virgo       earth -ve Mercury<br>
 5. Leo         fire  +ve Sun<br>
 4. Cancer      water -ve Moon<br>
 3. Gemini      air   +ve Mercury<br>
 2. Taurus      earth -ve Venus<br>
 1. Aries       fire  +ve Mars<br>
<br>
Then they are rearranged according <br>
to elements in order of vibration,<br>
i.e. fire, air, water, earth:<br>
<br>
 9. Sagittarius fire +ve Jupiter<br>
 5. Leo         fire +ve Sun<br>

<h6>Experience of Reality</h6>

Reality is a multi-layered experience with both objective and subjective elements. Objective reality, although experienced subjectively is accepted as consisting of real objects in the outside world that are seemingly uniformly experienced by the majority. On the other hand, subjective reality is a conditional experience that relies on personal sensory perception, reaction, cognition and comprehension. These four experiences are the result of the realities of <i>the world, the body, the mind and the soul</i>.
<br>
<br>
Subjective reality is a combination of phenomena that occur on the sensory, emotional, mental and spiritual levels. Observation of the outside world is much easier than that of the inside world. To function in the outer world there is no reason to know the inner. Each human is capable of functioning on an unconscious animalistic level without a need for self-knowledge. Nevertheless, some people have an urge to discover personal identity which occurs for no other reason than by wilful desire of the soul.
<br>
<br>
Observation of the outer world offers knowledge of the inner through inference. This relies on the notion that perception parallels identity and that observation of the world is only possible through analogy to the self. What is observed is being seen for a reason. Where observation encompasses more than the fundamental needs for survival, excess information must relate to something more than the basic functioning of the body. It is seemingly superfluous information that may be related to personal identity.
<br>
<br>
Throughout history the excess of information being received by the human mind has received a multitude of treatments as well as a multitude of possible meanings about what it might be. Generally though, the usual means of dealing with the seemingly endless variety is to nominate similarities between isolated items so that manageable groups may be formed in order to denote relationships. The categorisation and classification is the basis of symbolism.
<br>
<br>
The body is the medium through which the mind can perceive the world with the physical senses. But the senses are not directly apprehended by the mind, they are only available through the intermediary emotional reaction. Emotional reaction in the body may be realised by the mind as being the same as that of another person's observation of the individual's body as an object in the other's world. Therefore, since the other person can't see into the can't see into the mind or soul of the individual being observed, since only the individual experiences them, the other person only has a view of the identity of the individual through the impression created by the body as an object and the body's actions and reactions - the emotional state.
<br>
<br>
<h6>Four Levels of Identity</h6>

The Four Levels and Three Modes of Identity are specifically derived from the seven planets and twelve signs in a hierarchical manner ascending through their elements and polarity. In the personal chart they reveal detailed unique characteristics of the native. In the Hermetic Cosmos, everything is made out of the four cosmic elements of fire, air, water and earth.

<h6>The Four Levels of Identity<br>in Neoplatonism</h6>
<img src="img/identity/plotinus.jpg" alt="" class="modal-img limg" onclick="clk(this)" style="width:100%; border-radius: 8px;">
<p>
Plotinus, founder of Neoplatonism<!--, strongly influenced  by Hermetism
-->
<br>
<br>
The study of the levels of identity was maintained by the philosopher Plotinus in his system of Neoplatonism. For Plotinus and his follower Porphyry, the emanations are as follows:<br>
<b>To Hen (τό ἕν), The One</b>: Deity without quality, sometimes called The Good.<br>
<b>Nous (Νοῦς), Mind</b>: The Universal consciousness, from which proceeds<br>
<b>Psychē (Ψυχή), Soul</b>: Including both individual and world soul, leading finally to<br>
<b>Physis (Φύσις), Nature</b>.<br>

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
