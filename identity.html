<h1 class="title"><span>Four Levels of Identity in Hermetical Astrology</span></h1>

The Four Levels and Three Modes of Identity are generally derived from the seven planets and twelve signs in a hierarchical manner ascending through their elements and polarity. In the personal chart they reveal detailed unique characteristics of the native. In the Hermetic Cosmos, everything is made out of the four cosmic elements of fire, air, water and earth.<br>
<br>
These are combined with the creation of each new being. The positions of planets within their zodiacal signs reveal the true nature and to some extent, destiny.<br>

The Four Levels of Identity<br>
In Neoplatonism<br>
<br>
The study of the levels of identity was maintained by the philosopher Plotinus in his system of Neoplatonism. For Plotinus and his follower Porphyry, the emanations are as follows:<br>
<br>
    To Hen (τό ἕν), The One: Deity without quality, sometimes called The Good.<br>
    Nous (Νοῦς), Mind: The Universal consciousness, from which proceeds<br>
    Psychē (Ψυχή), Soul: Including both individual and world soul, leading finally to<br>
    Physis (Φύσις), Nature.<br>
<br>
Plotinus:<br>
Know thyself<br>
Self-discovey<br>
Self-awareness

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is routed in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
