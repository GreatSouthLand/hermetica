<h1 class="title"><span>Four Levels of Identity in Hermetical Astrology</span></h1>

The Four Levels and Three Modes of Identity are generally derived from the seven planets and twelve signs in a hierarchical manner ascending through their elements and polarity. In the personal chart they reveal detailed unique characteristics of the native. In the Hermetic Cosmos, everything is made out of the four cosmic elements of fire, air, water and earth.<br>
<br>
These are combined with the creation of each new being. The positions of planets within their zodiacal signs reveal the true nature and to some extent, destiny.<br>
<br>

The Four Levels of Identity<br>
In Neoplatonism<br>
<br>
The study of the levels of identity was maintained by the philosopher Plotinus in his system of Neoplatonism. For Plotinus and his follower Porphyry, the emanations are as follows:<br>
<br>
    To Hen (τό ἕν), The One: Deity without quality, sometimes called The Good.<br>
    Nous (Νοῦς), Mind: The Universal consciousness, from which proceeds<br>
    Psychē (Ψυχή), Soul: Including both individual and world soul, leading finally to<br>
    Physis (Φύσις), Nature.<br>
<br>
Plotinus:<br>
Know thyself<br>
Self-discovey<br>
Self-awareness

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and just like many others, I am a descendant of Australian immigrants who settled in the newly formed colonies of Queensland and New South Wales in the nineteenth century. The idea behind these pages is to present the stories and characters of those early settlers along with information about their origins, descendants, families, whereabouts and activities.
<br><br>
There are often themes running through their struggles and
achievements telling a tale of resourcefulness and hardships in an alien world.
The paradox of Australia as an ancient and raw continent and as a 'New World' portrays
a collision of ideals and realities yet still shows a continuity in how those people dealt with everyday life.
<br><br>
One and a half centuries later, the collectable information available to recreate
a realistic picture of these people is not altogether detailed or consistent. Yet there are
still many traces remaining that we have managed to gather together here.
<br><br>
<strong>A family history</strong> such as this is obviously full of impressions and opinions
laced together with as much historical information as is available but telling the complete story or stories still remains to be seen. Very often only scant real information is available. <br>
We are very grateful to those people who have already put in a lot of effort, especially for
making records, articles and memorials available and to anyone interested in reading this <strong>so here's a hearty thanks!</strong>
<br><br>
Comments and contributions are always welcome.
