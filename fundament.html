<h1 class="title"><span>Fundamental Cosmology of Hermetical Astrology</span></h1>

For historians, Hermetism is comprised of two main streams of thought, philosophical and technical. Since this section is dealing with concepts which would necessarily be part of the philosophical, this is indeed where they are to be found. Sources include the seventeen texts forming the so-called Corpus Hermeticum rediscovered in the Renaissance, the Poimander so popular throughout medieval times and the Kybalion from the 20th century. There are also many references and extracts to be found in the writings of the great thinkers of the past, such as the Stoics, Neoplatonists, Gnostics and Scholastics. So, let's start at the beginning.
<br><br>

Yet, before we do, there are some technical terms which should be clearly defined to make sense of them within the Hermetic context. 



<!--h6>Nous</h6-->


<h6>Logos and Cosmos</h6>

The earliest record of these two words being coined as technical terms was by Heraclitus of Ephesus (c.535–c.475 BC). For Heraclitus, Logos was in flux, in the same way as was meant by the earliest Hermetic texts. As a universal governing principle of order and knowledge, Logos combines everything into an orderly structure, which Heraclitus called Cosmos. 
<br><br>
The Sophists were quick to pick up the term Logos, and attributed the meaning of "discourse" to it. This was very likely because they were wandering philosophers readily giving speeches on any subject for money. Aristotle (c.384 c.322 BC) expanded the meaning into "reasoned discourse", alongside pathos and ethos, as the three parts of rhetoric. At the end of the 5th century BC, the Stoics took another path referring to the "logos spermatikos" as the generative principle of the universe. Philo (c. 20 BC – c.50 AD) integrated the term into Jewish philosophy. From there, the Christian and hence modern usage, meaning "Word" or "Discourse", were read into the term Logos.
<br><br>
Logos was a common term in the Greek language of the late sixth century
BCE and is derived from légō (λέγω, "say", "speak") and has the basic meanings of "word" (spoken or written) or "utterance." (Jack Lawson, "Mesopotamian Precursors to the Stoic Concept of Logos"). We must suppose, if the Ionian philosophers identified Word with cosmic reason and first principle, that they were induced and influenced by some well-known semi-philosophical use of the term "Word of the gods" as the personification of divine agency. (S. Langdon, "The Babylonian Conception of the Logos")
<br><br>
For Heraclitus, there were two distinct versions of Cosmos. Idios kosmos (Greek: ίδιος κόσμος) is a peorson's "own world" or "private world" as distinguished from the "common world" (koinos kosmos). The origin of the term is attributed to fragment B89 (Diels–Kranz numbering) of the pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus:  "The waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own." The term has various interpretations: idios kosmos is associated with dreaming, imagination, and delusion; koinos kosmos with wakefulness, reason, and consensus reality. (wikipedia)
<br><br>

Much, if not all of the ideas from Heraclitus are in tune with Hermetism. This is not surprising, for as Heraclitus himself says that he uses his Personal Logos to speak the truths of the true, Divine Logos. Although it was possibly the fashion at the time, Heraclitus did not take the word "Logos" to mean "discourse" (see T.M.Robinson, Heraclitus, Fragments, p.74-75). Instead, he more likely meant "true explanation" or "true statement" as "divine law". Heraclitus often used the terms "koinos logos" meaning "Common Logos" and "eidos logos" for "Personal Logos" (modern: "Soul's Logos").
<br><br>

Quotes from Heraclitus:
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Soul possesses a logos (measure, proportion) which increases itself. </i> (fragment 115)
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;- But the logos is 'common' to all </i>(fragment 2), <i>did they but know it; they are 'absent' from it while 'present' to it </i>(fragment 34).
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;- Heraclitus held that the recurrent fire is everlasting, and that destiny is a logos which fashions existent things through the contrariety of the directions in which they tend to run.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;- Heraclitus tried to show that that logos which pervades (the) essence of the universe is (the) essence of destiny.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;- Heraclitus says, then, that this 'common' and divine logos - by participation in which we become rational - is the yardstick of truth. So that which appears (such and such) to all in common is trustworthy (for it is grasped by the 'common' and divine logos), but that which strikes only an individual as (such-and-such) is - for the opposite reason - untrustworthy.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;- For having in these words expressly stated the view that we do and apprehend everything thanks to our participation in the divine logos, he goes on a little further, then adds: That is why it is necessary to follow that which is (common). Though the account (logos) is common, however, the many live as though they had a private understanding' (fragment 2). This logos is nothing else than an explanation (exposition, articulation, exegesis) of the mode of arrangement of the universe. That is why we speak truly whenever and in so far as we share in the recollection of it (ie, of the logos, TMR) but are invariably mistaken on matters of private opinion.
<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;- So here and in these words he states clearly that the common logos is the yardstick (of truth); the things that appear such and such in common are trustworthy, as being judged by the common logos, whereas those that appear (such and such) to each person privately are false.

<br><br>
Furthermore, in Hermetic Philosophy, the terms Logos and Cosmos have very special meanings which become more apparent by learning about the Cosmology of Hermes Trismegistus:
<br><br>


<!--
For Heraclitus, Logos was a universal governing
principle – that which provided continuity
amid flux. It is logos which makes the
world an orderly structure, a kosmos.
-->


<h2 class="title">In the Beginning...</h2>


<!--h6>In the Beginning...</h6-->

As was mentioned on the page of <a href="index.html">Introduction</a>, Hermetism formed out of a syncretism of the various cultures brought together upon the establishment of the Alexandrian Empire. The subject of concern here is that which underlies the various concepts of Hermetism. This involves the cosmology of the system itself which is comprised of a cosmogeny, of how everything came into being, and a cosmography, of what everything is. 
<br><br>
The cultures which formed the basis included Babylonian, Sumerian, Akkadian, Egyptian and Anatolian. All of these originally had their own cosmologies, often with commonalities, and were eventually absorbed into the Hermetic Cosmology. It would be safe to say that the new Hermetic thought created its own cosmology to cover the concerns previously addressed by its predecessors. That's not unique. Even the young Johann Wolfgang von Goethe at the onset of Romanticism tried his hand at making up his own Cosmology.

<h6>The Hermetic Creation Myth</h6>

There are lots of creation myths stemming from the ancient world and naturally, Hermetism comes with its own. What is especially outstanding though, is the form in which the story is presented. All the way through the seventeen texts of the Corpus Hermeticism as well as the Pymander, the Nag Hammadi and others, is a technique employed whereby a mysterious all-knowing figure, usually Hermes himself or Poimandres, appears to an unsuspecting receiver of some great wisdom. Sometimes this person is called Tat, another time Asclepius or King Ammon

<h6>The Cosmos and The Logos</h6>

First and foremost is the Hermetic story of how the Cosmos was created but it might be best to first mention a few observations about the message of the Hermetic texts. Since God is All and is All Mind without material substance, the one thing God was lacking was to experience anything of substance. A vast and limitless mind thinking of nothing. The myth seems to tell of the urgency of bringing something into being which would gather experiences and provide a means to bring them back to report on life, the cosmos and everything. That means was, and still is, meant to be humanity.
<br><br>
This is not automatic and naturally enough not everyone can achieve this aim without much effort and as Madame Blavatsky put it:
<br>
<div class="quotebox">
<i>
As the laggards in a race struggle and plod in their first quarter while the
victor darts past the goal, so, in the race of immortality, some souls outspeed all the rest and reach the end, while their myriad competitors are toiling under the load of matter, close to the startingpoint. Some unfortunates fall out entirely, and lose all chance of the prize; some retrace their steps and begin again. This is what the Hindu dreads above all things — transmigration and reincarnation; only on other and inferior planets, never on this one.
</i><br>
(Isis Unveiled, Vol.1 p346)
</div>

<h6>The Cosmology and Cosmogony - The Details of Creation</h6>

The All (To Pan) was All Mind (Nous) and Light and was All God and contained that which became The Cosmos and Everything within it. The All was limitless, light and sweet.  And a darkness began to settle like a coiled snake which turned into Moist Nature which tossed about  and wailed with firey smoke. 
<br>
Then out of The Light came the Holy Word, The Logos, which descended upon Nature. And upwards leapt fire, followed by air out of the earth and water, which were intermingled and too heavy to rise. Yet they were moved to hear by reason of The Spirit-Word-Logos pervading them.
<br><br>
The Light prior to Moist Nature is God.
<br>
The Light-Word-Logos is the son of God.
<br><br>
What one hears and sees in oneself is the Lord's-Word-Logos but Mind is Father-God.<br>
And they are a unity (Note that these are referred to in this work as Personal Logos and Cosmic Logos).
<br><br>
Upon Creation of The Cosmos, The All, The Mind and God, all also came into existence. This was an act of Will within The All to bring about primary matter out of which everything is created. The primary matter in turn divided into the four elements of fire, air, water and earth.
<br><br>
God then ordered the four elements into becoming the seven heavens of the seven planets. Out of the materialising of the four elements, The Logos, The Word, sprang forth into being. Nous then ordered that the planets spin and move in their orbits. They moved within the 8th heaven of the fixed stars and all within the 9th heaven, The Primum Mobile.
<br><br>
The movement of the heavens brought forth creatures without reason or speech. The Earth was then separated from The Water and animals except for man were created. The God then created androgynous mankind, in God's own image, and handed over creation to mankind.
<br><br>
Note that the 8th and 9th heavens are the topic of the Nag Hammadi Codex VI, Discourse (Logoi) on the Eighth and Ninth, "The Ogdoad Reveals the Ennead".

Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
