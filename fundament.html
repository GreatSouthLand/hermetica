<h1 class="title"><span>Fundamental Cosmology of Hermetical Astrology</span></h1>

For historians, Hermetism is comprised of two main streams of thought, philosophical and technical. Since this section is dealing with concepts which would necessarily be part of the philosophical, this is indeed where they are to be found. Sources include the seventeen texts forming the so-called Corpus Hermeticum rediscovered in the Renaissance, the Poimander so popular throughout medieval times and the Kybalion from the 20th century. There are also many references and extracts to be found in the writings of the great thinkers of the past, such as the Stoics, Neoplatonists, Gnostics and Scholastics. So, let's start at the beginning.


<h6>In the Beginning...</h6>

As was mentioned on the page of <a href="index.html">Introduction</a>, Hermetism formed out of a syncretism of the various cultures brought together upon the establishment of the Alexandrian Empire. The subject of concern here is that which underlies the various concepts of Hermetism. This involves the cosmology of the system itself which is comprised of a cosmogeny, of how everything came into being, and a cosmography, of what everything is. 
<br><br>
The cultures which formed the basis included Babylonian, Sumerian, Akkadian, Egyptian and Anatolian. All of these originally had their own cosmologies, often with commonalities, and were eventually absorbed into the Hermetic Cosmology. It would be safe to say that the new Hermetic thought created its own cosmology to cover the concerns previously addressed by its predecessors. That's not unique. Even the young Johann Wolfgang von Goethe at the onset of Romanticism tried his hand at making up his own Cosmology.

<h6>The Hermetic Creation Myth</h6>

There are lots of creation myths stemming from the ancient world and naturally, Hermetism comes with its own. What is especially outstanding though, is the form in which the story is presented. All the way through the seventeen texts of the Corpus Hermeticism as well as the Pymander, the Nag Hammadi and others, is a technique employed whereby a mysterious all-knowing figure, usually Hermes himself or Poimandres, appears to an unsuspecting receiver of some great wisdom. Sometimes this person is called Tat, another time Asclepius or King Ammon

<h6>The Cosmos and The Logos</h6>

First and foremost is the Hermetic story of how the Cosmos was created but it might be best to first mention a few observations about the message of the Hermetic texts. Since God is All and is All Mind without material substance, the one thing God was lacking was to experience anything of substance. A vast and limitless mind thinking of nothing. The myth seems to tell of the urgency of bringing something into being which would gather experiences and provide a means to bring them back to report on life, the cosmos and everything. That means was, and still is, meant to be humanity.
<br><br>

<h6>The Cosmology and Cosmogony - The Details of Creation</h6>

The All (To Pan) was All Mind (Nous) and Light and was All God and contained that which became The Cosmos and Everything within it. The All was limitless, light and sweet.  And a darkness began to settle like a coiled snake which turned into Moist Nature which tossed about  and wailed with firey smoke. 
<br>
Then out of The Light came the Holy Word, The Logos, which descended upon Nature. And upwards leapt fire, followed by air out of the earth and water, which were intermingled and too heavy to rise. Yet they were moved to hear by reason of The Spirit-Word-Logos pervading them.
<br><br>
The Light prior to Moist Nature is God.
<br>
The Light-Word-Logos is the son of God.
<br><br>
What one hears and sees in oneself is the Lord's-Word-Logos but Mind is Father-God.<br>
And they are a unity (Note that these are referred in this work as Personal Logos and Cosmic Logos).
<br><br>
Upon Creation of The Cosmos, The All, The Mind and God, all also came into existence. This was an act of Will within The All to bring about primary matter out of which everything is created. The primary matter in turn divided into the four elements of fire, air, water and earth.
<br><br>
God then ordered the four elements into becoming the seven heavens of the seven planets. Out of the materialising of the four elements, The Logos, The Word, sprang forth into being. Nous then ordered that the planets spin and move in their orbits. They moved within the 8th heaven of the fixed stars and all within the 9th heaven, The Primum Mobile.
<br><br>
The movement of the heavens brought forth creatures without reason or speech. The Earth was then separated from The Water and animals except for man were created. The God then created androgynous mankind, in God's own image, and handed over creation to mankind.
<br><br>
Note that the 8th and 9th heavens are the topic of the Nag Hammadi Codex VI, Discourse (Logoi) on the Eighth and Ninth, "The Ogdoad Reveals the Ennead".

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
