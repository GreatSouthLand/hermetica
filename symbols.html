<h1 class="title">Astrology and its Symbols</h1>

Astrology is a language. It has its own alphabet, grammar and syntax, and just like with any other language, needs to be learnt to be able to read and write it. Listening or mouthing is not enough. Since it is an artificial construct for a particular purpose and employs the use of symbols more than 'natural' languages, it could be best called a symbolic language.
<br><br>
A lot has been said about astrology being something other than an elaborate language but this confusion clearly arises from similarities to its much modified descendents, religion and science. Grasping astrology, requires a fundamental acceptance of what existence really is, the nature of which is encapsulated in the underlying 

<a href="fundament.html">&raquo; Hermetic Cosmology</a>. 

The World, the Cosmos, is made up of the physical, material, tangible stuff of creation, as well as the spiritual, immaterial, intangible, divine realm. This realm is excluded from science as non-existent and from religion as somewhere out there, in heaven.
<br><br>
The word heaven is important here. It betrays where religion got the idea. It's Hermetic. Yet the heaven of religion has, just like with science, been rationalised away from the individual person and rendered inaccessible from daily life. Hermetic ideas give access to the immaterial and spiritual experience of life. This is especially important for human existence, because the Hermetic message is that each new person has been created in the same manner as the very first. The creation continues, life goes on. Creation didn't end on the seventh day.
<br><br>
Within our Hermetic myths and legends, Hermes and Thoth, as well as Hermes Trismegistus himself, invented language and gave it to the world. He also invented astrology and it would follow that astrology is a symbolic language. In the spirit of its Egyptian roots astrological symbols are much more loaded than ordinary letters, being more like hieroglyphs.
<br><br>
Luckily for us, the hellenizing ancient Greeks who struggled with the meanings of the hieroglyphic nature of Egyptian understanding, created a whole new set of terms which are preserved for us, especially within astrological concepts. These terms, once learnt and grasped intellectually, automatically provide a whole new way of perceiving and comprehending the world.

<h6>Astrological Symbols, Signs, Signatures, Sigils and Correspondences</h6>

With astrology relying heavily on communicating a lot of information in the most concise form, the following linguistic techniques are often employed. Although these words are too often treated as synonyms, they do actually have different meanings.<br> 
<br>
<b>Symbols</b> are best defined as a representation of something else. For instance, in the art movement of Symbolism, death may be depicted as a skull. In astrology, a lion is used as a symbol to depict the character of the sign of Leo. 
<br><br>
<b>Signs</b> in astrology refer to the twelve divisions of the zodiac. They are indicators as to the general character of that part of the zodiac.
<br><br>
<b>Sigils</b>, sometimes known as glyphs are pictograms. Because they are similar to letters of the alphabet, sigils are used as a sort of abbreviation for the full name of something, and once learnt, are easier to read. Astrological sigils have also frequently been used in alchemical texts but are often attributed a different meaning
<br><br>
<b>Signatures</b> are indications appearing in nature having an affinity or correspondence to ailments of the human body. Rooted in astrological medicine, this doctrine has been in use since the time of Dioscorides and Galen. Paracelsus (1493–1541) further developed the concept, writing that "Nature marks each growth ... according to its curative benefit".
<br><br>
<b>Correspondences</b> are those things in the Cosmos which are similar in nature to that which they correspond. For instance, in astrological medicine, the heart corresponds to the sign of Leo and the Sun which rules it.
<br><br>


<h6>Macrocosm and Microcosm</h6>

Originating in ancient Greece, probably with the philosopher Anaximander (c. 610 – c. 546 BCE), there is the notion that every human being can be treated as a microcosm, a little world, similar to the macrocosm, the entire cosmos, the big world.  

The esoteric movements of the early modern era, from the 17th century on, such as the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross, The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and even Feemasonry, all of Hermetic nature, picked up on the idea as the basis for their movements.
<!--
developed the idea of each and every human, being a microcosm, a small world, which is similar to the macrocosm, the entire cosmos. 
-->
This of course was astrologically derived and intimately connected to the earlier correspondences in astrological medicine, the major interest of learned people before our modern era.
<br><br>

<h6>Hermetic Man</h6>

Viewed in the light of a microcosm, as a creation in its own right, with the body as the natural part animated by a soul, and a spiritual mind as the divine part, a more complete picture arises. This topic is of major concern within Hermetic Astrology and is treated more thoroughly in the section on the 

<a href="identity.html">&raquo; Levels of Identity</a>.
<br><br>

<h6>Substance = Understanding</h6>

The so called material world has been a concern for millennia as to its nature and composition.  A lot of misunderstanding arises from the multitude of loaded meanings for the words used to describe the stuff of the world. This has been compounded by translations between languages. For instance, in ancient Greek there is the word ousia, which in Latin is most translated into substance. Trying to deal with these words etymologically is problematic. Substance literally means that which is standing under something as its actuality. The English word understanding also literally means that, sometimes. The Stoics got around this by declaring that everything in existence is physical, substantial and material. For them, the spiritual realm was an extension of the physical, simply more imperceptible to some.

<p>The Twelve Signs of The Zodiac</p>
</div>


<h2 class="title">The Twelve Signs of The Zodiac</h2>


The circle of the Zodiac contains twelve signs, each with a different symbolic character. Even though for most astrological applications these are treated as discreet (separate) entities, the zodiac itself is continuous. In Hermetic Astrology, there is a natural transition from one sign to another. The last degrees of one sign are already showing the character of the next.
<br>
<br>
The whole circle of the Zodiac can be viewed in a similar way to that of the "Fool's Journey" through the Major Arcana of the Tarot. In our case, the fool starts out at Aries, keen and unaware of pitfalls or dangers. Travelling through each of the twelve signs, the native acquires some things in life whether they be material stuff or experiences from interacting with the world. The outcome is to end up at the last sign, Pisces, which is concerned about everything in the world, cosmos or universe, exoterically and esoterically. This can escalate to the ultimate need of starting over again with that which has been learnt and become a new type of fool.

The Signs and Their Meaning</h2>


The Ruler of a sign is the planet with the most symbolism in common with it.
<br>
<i>+ve means expressive / manipulative, <br>
-ve means receptive / creative</i>
<br>
<br>
The Modes reveal the dynamic flow of energy within sections of a cycle, whereby 
Cardinal relates to growing and bringing on something new, Fixed is a sustaining mode holding onto something already in the existence and Mutable means transforming and facilitation or variation in something.<br>
<br>
The Element of a Sign reveals the basic symbolic material. Fire - is impulsive, intentional and eager, Air - is inventive, mentally-active and volatile, Water - is  emotional, sensitive, changeable, creative and Earth - is practical, realistic, materialistic, stable. <br>
<br>

</div>
At the start of Aries in traditional and modern astrology, the symbolism is fairly clear and our analogy of the fool about to set out on a journey works quite well; naive and keen to make a personal statement. This doesn't mean being the center of attention, that is more like Leo in which case an audience is needed. The Aries style is more centered and focused and if anything, revels in contrasting to that which is around by standing out alone. Also at the lower degrees, Aries will show aptitude for the symbols and issues of the sign before. This could possibly make for showing off esoteric knowledge and skills normally belonging in the realm of Pisces. Many astrologers fall into this category. So does Johann Sebastian Bach for example, who with his Aries Sun was an expert at religious music. Towards the end of Aries there is such an exaggerated need for self-expression that it will soon become obvious that something is lacking. That "something" is the symbol of the second sign of the zodiac, Taurus and works just as well as the symbolism for the second phase of any cycle.

Traditionally Taurus relates to possessions which the native has or gets. This could be personal, such as bodily attributes, talents or behaviour, as well as that which could be acquired from the world such as personal property or achievement. Being ruled by Venus, there is a keen affinity to substantial things and matters, as well as innate sense for what can be used where. The Earth element combined with the fixed mode makes for a stability not seen elsewhere. Here we can find reliability and can trust that once something is started, it will reach an end. The early degrees might express themselves through artistic appreciation or endeavours, keen business acumen or simply a life of indulgence, As the degrees progress the understanding of the material world increases to the point of making something out of it. Here comes creativity, ingenuity and often talent combined with hard work to bring something wonderful into the world. In the highest degrees, communication of ideas as symbolised by the third sign, Gemini, are in dire demand.

Gemini is a talkative sign. The same goes for Phase Three. That's probably why it is allocated to twins, providing a ready and eager conversational partner, even if simply to oneself. With an ever active mind, and keen to say what's on it, ideas come easily as if plucked out of the air, which is its astrological element. The mutability of this sign adds a restlessness as each thought moves on to the next intriguing topic of interest. Being ruled by the silver tongued Mercury, messenger to the Gods, makes for fast and smooth transitions which are barely noticeable. Some have remarked that this is somewhat akin to birdlike behaviour flitting from one source of nectar to the next. Being Mercurial by nature can also be a little slippery when it comes down to establishing a firm opinion or attitude. Generally in such cases, conviction can still be found elsewhere in a chart and when it is, it will be spoken about, liberally. At the early degrees of this sign or phase, the leftover issues from the themes of the second sign or phase, that is of 'things', are usually spoken of in great detail. The larger degrees are not too comfortable with matters of great gravity but when at hand will normally be expressed as impersonal issues of dire concern. It urges for the stability to be found in the next sign or phase, a new base, a place to call home.

Following after the last nervous degrees of the third chord of astrological symbolism, our journey seeks solace and protection from the world. This fourth chord is related to the Moon ruled Cancer and seeks a home in which to settle to collect and recollect the thoughts and impressions of the world,  reflecting over what has happened and make plans for the future. The start of Cancer and 4th phase represent the lowest point below the horizon and setting out from there means acquiring common knowledge and cultural values. These are normally learnt in the nest, so to speak, and carried with us wherever life takes us. In fact, where someone with phase four is to be found will also be someone making oneself at home. At the final degrees, an urgency will arise to overcome this and get out and about, meet people and have a life of one"s own as is the case for the Leonine fifth chord.

</div>
Being ruled by the Sun, both Leo and Phase five both shine best when being at the center of attention. Leo is a natural at this sort of thing usually having a warm character that attracts an audience and a regal demeanour that warrants it. Phase five on the other hand has a tendency to move into the correct circles where this will happen, as if naturally. Yet it is never unjustified, as a lot of energy gets poured into deserving this acknowledgement. At the later degrees this can easily be overdone leading to health problems, the issue of the next section of the circle.

</div>
The sixth vibration of the wheel of the zodiac is that of Virgo and Phase Six. Ruled by Mercury in its receptive and creative mode often leads to concern over details to the point of worry. Yet this is just as often dealt with as it comes, through finding and developing methods to apply mindful techniques. This is the last segment of the circle below the horizon and as such is the last, and probably the largest of the personal concerns. It encompasses health issues and all things to do with personal exchange in the world. The final degrees are heading out into where others are encountered and that exchange will eventually require dealing with other people.

</div>
This is the classic house of relationships. Both Libra and Phase Seven are ruled by Venus in its positive, outgoing mode. Of course, encounters with other people rely greatly on personal skills, so some can also end up as confrontations. Being symbolised by the scales, as well as being ruled by Venus, can lead to evaluations of others and weighing -up of situations to the point of great attraction or rejection. In the highest degrees, tensions can build and the juices will flow.

Even though there are 12 signs and phases, the last four are ruled only by the larger, outer planets, Jupiter and Saturn, which present most people with issues that are so large and impersonal, that their astrological foray into the world ends with the eighth chord, Scorpio or Phase Eight. To top that off it's ruled by the negative side of Mars,the malefic bringer of war. That is why it is for most,  connected to death, mystery, sex, darkness, violence and finality. Yet it is also the realm of revealing that which is not normally seen. This of course in the later degrees brings about the urgency and necessity for going beyond the ordinary into the realm of the ninth chord.

Sagittarius, the Archer, has an aim in life and that is to go beyond normality and explore that which may be beyond. Jupiter as ruler ensures unlimited endurance and success whether it be intellectual, cultural, athletic, legislative, philosophical or any other pursuit regarded as unnecessary but highly culturally rewarding. Phase nine has the added advantage of having a knack if overcoming the hurdles of the previous phase by turning those issues into skills, effectively filling the quiver full of arrows. In the later degrees, there are dangers of overdoing it and needed some restraint and circumspection, the issues of the next chord.

It's now time for our astro-traveller to get organised. A lot of life's lessons have been acquired and these now need to be sorted and put to good use. Lists and accounts can be made, meetings arranged and appointments kept. The Zenith, the highest point above the horizon has been reached as it is overtaken, Capricorn and Phase Nine come into their own. This is the realm of the public life, of hierarchy, politics, management, fame, success and achievement. Time itself falls under the auspices of Saturn, as do calendars and observances of official holy events and occasions for proclamations and duties. With that is also maturity and the accompanying sorrows or misfortunes of ageing. Will there be enough time to get more done? The later degrees show that total control might not be the only solution and that consideration of the social repercussions is rising higher on the agenda. That's the realm of Aquarius and Phase Eleven, coming up next.

Saturn also rules Aquarius and Phase Eleven, but this time from its positive, outgoing and expressive side. The humanitarian spirit is at its strongest here and everything dealing with the greater welfare of humankind is at stake. This is the place where social groups are formed, bringing together people of like-mindedness in the interests of all. The social awareness of what is happening to others is acted upon and although at times disruptive, it is the long term benefit which is held high. Movements of all sorts have happened within these contexts. Changes have been made. Radical behaviour, in both senses of the word (fundamental and misbehaved), have in many cases been the only way to overthrow too much control within a system maintaining too much for the few and too little for the many. So this is where the underdog, the little man, the victims can all pull together as a team. So what can go wrong with visions of Utopia? Realistically it is not possible and ambitions can be dashed into chaos of too many conflicting attitudes. This becomes highly apparent in the later degrees where the issues become too varied and possibly getting in the way of each other. There becomes a need for a more spiritual, less mundane approach to the world.

Ever sensitive, somewhat fluid, Pisces and Phase Twelve are now at hand, feeling everything but not too sure of anything. This is the realm of mystics and dreamers, somewhat akin too our previous Utopians. But there is another dimension to this chord as if struck somewhere out in the cosmos in the universal consciousness. People on this vibration have a different attitude towards life as if they see a larger picture and take it all in as it comes. Overload and overflow are inevitable. Depending on the resilience and fortitude shown in other parts of a chart, people such as this might have trouble keeping on the ball but they, like the previous chord, can make the world a better place by not being so confined to personal issues which would otherwise lead to selfishness. Ironically, as our astrological fool's journey comes to an end, the final degrees of the last segment of the circle, needs to loosen up and think of more of oneself as being just part of the whole eternal cosmic unity of a Hermetic ideal. This is traditionally the house of one's own undoing.

The Planets - Moving Celestial Bodies
<p>
The word planet is derived from an ancient Greek word planētēs (πλανήτης), meaning wanderer. All seven of the planets, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn can be observed to move through the zodiac, not far from the ecliptic.

<h2 class="title">More Symbols of Astrology<br>The Planets and Their Meaning</h2>


While the zodiacal signs are actually fixed stars within the firmament of the sky, the planets are forever moving through them. Just like the signs, the planets have important symbolic meaning. In Hermetic Astrology, the planets are handled in what is called the Chaldean Order, which organises them in ascending order according to how long they appear to encircle the Earth. The fastest is the Moon and starts the list.

<div class="astro" style="width:100%; padding:10px; margin-right:8px;">
Chaldean Order:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>a</span>&nbsp;Moon,&nbsp;
<span>b</span>&nbsp;Mercury,&nbsp;
<span>c</span>&nbsp;Venus,&nbsp; 
<span>d</span>&nbsp;Sun,&nbsp; 
<span>e</span>&nbsp;Mars,&nbsp; 
<span>f</span>&nbsp;Jupiter,&nbsp; 
<span>g</span>&nbsp;Saturn&nbsp;
</div>

The term Chaldean refers to the Hellenistic Hermetic Astrology practised in the region previously known as Babylonian. Until modern times, astrologers practising that flavour of astrology were often simply called Chaldeans. One of those, named Vettius Valens, outlines how the ancients connected the planets to the signs. Each of the seven planets has its own symbolism. Here are some very brief examples. Knowing this basic information helps makes more sense when dealing with two together forming a phase within a cycle.<br>

<h4><b><span>a</span>&nbsp;Moon</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: emotion, sensitivity, reflection<br>
Ruler of Cancer<br>
<hr class="blank">
The Moon is like a deep pool of feelings, reflections, memories and unformed thoughts. Being related to everyday speaking and listening, it buffers both incoming and outgoing information so smoothly and automatically that there is no need for conscious monitoring. This can be good in some ways but often things are said without wanting, or knowing, to have said them. An important consideration regarding the Moon is how close it is to the Earth at the time of an event (determined by calculation), as this can have quite an impact on its expression. The closer the Moon is to the Earth, the faster is its apparent motion, which in turn produces significantly faster lunar reactions and responses.

<h4><b><span>b</span>&nbsp;Mercury</b></h4>
Some Keywords: thought, adaptability, speed<br>
Ruler of Gemini and Virgo<br>
<hr class="blank">
Mercury is the ancient Roman name adopted for the Greek god Hermes, whose name is still used in Greece for this planet. The symbols for these two gods are not identical but similar enough to determine something meaningful. First and foremost, Mercury is associated with communication, language, thought and ideas, but unlike the Moon, is quite conscious and intentional. When retrograde, expression of communication can be reversed often leading to greater skill at writing, often accompanied by starting at the end.

<div class="lbox astro" style="width:95%; padding: 12px 16px 16px 16px; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px;">
<h4><b><span>c</span>&nbsp;Venus</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: attraction, desire, harmony<br>
Ruler of Taurus and Libra<br>
<hr class="blank">
As ruler of the earthy, receptive and creative Taurus, Venus is the sensual planet, able to appreciate physical characteristics of things in the world. As the ruler of the airy and mindful Libra, Venus is also able to grasp aesthetics and balance harmony, so all round is constantly evaluating the worth and worthiness of whatever is encountered. When Venus is retrograde, it reverses its approach to matters at hand such that where it would normally be receptive, it becomes expressive. Someone in this situation usually has a deep seated feeling of being unappreciated despite receiving more than the usual amount of admiration.

<div class="lbox astro" style="width:95%; padding: 12px 16px 16px 16px; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px;">
<h4><b><span>d</span>&nbsp;Sun</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: energy, generosity, drive<br>
Ruler of Leo<br>
<hr class="blank">
The Sun is the eternal logos which brightens everything. It is the true self, the core purpose and undeviating importance in life. As ruler of Leo it revels in being at the center of attention to warm an appreciative audience. The Sun also describes one's energy source and level as well as enthusiasm, interest, optimism and spirit. Of course, the Sun can't have any affliction or negativity of its own but sometimes getting that glowing going can be problematic. What helps the most in such cases is to look at the Sun's relationships to other planets to gain greater access to potentials at hand. The key to the Sun's energy is to get it to flow.
</div>

<div class="lbox astro" style="width:95%; padding: 12px 16px 16px 16px; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px;">
<h4><b><span>e</span>&nbsp;Mars</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: impulse, movement, assertion<br>
Ruler of Aries and Scorpio<br>
<hr class="blank">
Mars is the planet of action. In a chart it shows where activities will have their greatest effect. Looking at its relationships to other planets can reveal easiness or difficulty when undertaking something, for instance, when in combination with the Sun, where one's energy can flow into one's actions. When Mars is retrograde, a rather unique situation arises. There is a tendency to overcompensate for the feeling of underachieving. The result is to apply so much more force that there can be a possibility of endangering oneself.
</div>

<div class="lbox astro" style="width:95%; padding: 12px 16px 16px 16px; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px;">
<h4><b><span>f</span>&nbsp;Jupiter</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: expansion, capability, fortune<br>
Ruler of Sagittarius and Pisces<br>
<hr class="blank">
This is the planet of largesse and extravagance, If something is being done and Jupiter is involved, then it often ends up being larger than life. Jupiter as ruler of Sagittarius, always tends to aim for more. Whether it be something sporty or educational, or with its connection to Pisces, religious or mystical, Jupiter will seek out the most of it. When Jupiter is retrograde, there could be an accompanying feeling of caution in whatever is undertaken, in an effort to ensure there is no wasting of time or resources. 
</div>

<div class="lbox astro" style="width:95%; padding: 12px 16px 16px 16px; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px;">
<h4><b><span>g</span>&nbsp;Saturn</b></h4> 
Some Keywords: limits, strength, definition<br>
Ruler of Capricorn and Aquarius<br>
<hr class="blank">
Even though Saturn is regarded as a malefic planet, meaning injurious or restrictive, getting to understand what Saturn actually does, can help overcome potential pitfalls or drawbacks. First and foremost is that Saturn relates to form. Attempting to form something into that which it can't be could be seen as either a frustrating experience or a safeguard to prevent deviation from that which would be more appropriate. When Saturn is retrograde, boundaries are not so well defined or perceived which could lead to doing something, or being somewhere, detrimental.

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
