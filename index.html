<h1 class="title">Welcome To <span>Hermetica Astrologia</span></h1>

Over the course of a few decades of the author's research into the nature of astrology, much material has come to light revealing its true character.
<br>
<br> 

We are born into a world, a universe, a cosmos, so vast it is incomprehensible in its entirety. That vastness is full of things that affect us, both directly when close, as well as indirectly, when distant. 

The perception of these things relies upon the occurrence of physiological phenomena for each and every one of us. Yet, perception is not always accurate. That which we have perceived is not necessarily an accurate match to that which was being perceived. 
<br>
<br>

Even if it were accurate, that which we hold is really only an idea or an image of the object and not the object itself. This is where we come into trouble for there are other processes at work which can modify the result.

This is where astrology comes into the picture. Because astrology is the study of the cosmos it is able to describe the things in the cosmos in such a way that they are independent of personal perception. As an example, astrology says that Mars is such and such but our perception of the planet in the sky is not going to yield that same information about Mars. So where did astrology get this arcane knowledge?
<br>
<br>





<!--
Not too surprisingly, even though astrology might have been preceded by celestial divination, it is not the same. Once it is known properly, it can't easily be dismissed as being either fortune telling or superstition. People who follow that path of thinking would do better reading the explanations and heeding the warnings which will be presented here.
<br>
-->

<h5>Let's Look at the Stars</h5>

Celestial observation and astrology itself may well be the first ever intellectual pursuit of humans struggling to make sense of the world surrounding them. The ultimate aim was to find more order and purpose in an otherwise mundane and seemingly flat existence. Ironically, this ancient system indeed described the cosmos as flat, which within the framework of astrology, it was and still is. 

<!--
The attempt to criticise this fact as an astronomical error only further betrays the ignorance within the holder of such a belief. Knowing that astrology is not astronomy is as absurd as knowing a dog is not a horse. 
-->
<br><br>

<!--
Yet this begs asking what astrology really is, who invented it and why. 

To discover the true answers to these questions is not too difficult, for this information has been available as long as astrology itself. The only difficulty arising is that because it is so incredibly ancient and has been such a major cause for concern,  perhaps even a threat for so long, that it has also had plenty of time to develop more than enough misunderstanding and anxious antagonism.

<h5>What Astrology Says</h5>

Central to the topic is a message broadcast since the earliest form of astrology and its associated philosophy. It was directly and intentionally levelled at a particular attitude. It warned against living in the material world as if it, and all its intendant flaws and apparent evils, were somehow inevitable and preferable to another more promising outlook.
<br><br>
A lot of this gloom and doom about the world is distinctly connected to Mesopotamian celestial divination going back about four thousand years. The ancient texts embraced the idea of terrible things coming from the skies which were to be seen only as omens requiring interpretation.
<br>


<h5>Out Steps Hermes Trismegistus</h5>

Perhaps as a reaction, a new form of thinking emerged, turning the tables such that if the energies can flow through channels from the heavens to the earth, then the pathway would also be open to head in the opposite direction, towards the Divine Cosmos.
<br><br>
Getting back to the origin of this new thinking, the historically claimed author of the subject was known to the ancient world as Hermes Trismegistus, a mysterious figure cast from a unity of the Greek Hermes and the Egyptian Thoth, legends referred to nowadays as gods.
<br><br>
Over time, a lot has been said about this person accompanied by speculation as to whether or not he was actually of flesh and blood or only the product of amalgamated symbolism of various different gods, priests or authors of his acclaimed writings.

<h5>The Hellenization of Ancient Egypt</h5>

A syncretism of ideas occurred at the time of Alexander the Great whose vast Empire stretched all the way from Greece, across Mesopotamia and Persia over to India. The result was a massive interchange of ideas already highly developed in those places.
<br><br>
So the root of study here lies in the ancient world and is based in Alexandria in Egypt, famed place of learning with its massive library, constituting in fact, the entire city acting as a stronghold of books and education. This new city acted as the leading light for the vast empire and was a magnet for intellectual pursuits from all parts.
<br><br>
Alexandria was also famed for its lighthouse known as Pharos, the first lighthouse ever to exist which became the prototype for all others since its construction. It was destroyed in the 14th century and at that time was the second oldest remaining of the Seven Great Wonders of the Ancient World.
<br><br>
When Alexander the Great established the city, the old town, Rhakotis, became the Egyptian quarter into which the Egyptian aristocracy who had been the former rulers, were confined and subsequently converted into a priestly caste only responsible for administering Egyptian religious issues. The interchange between these priests and the intellectual Greek migrant settlers led to the development of hybrid greek philosophy, education, religion and knowledge derived from Egyptian concepts and made Greek for the new audiences.
<br><br>
The Egyptian concepts clashed with the established Greek outlook on the world. By Greek understanding, ideas needed to be rigidly formed, immutable.and learnable. Egyptian concepts on the other hand were more like attitudes and approaches in a steady stream of thought.
<br><br>
Greek ideas, like what something actually is, were superfluous and irrelevant to the Egyptian mind. As a result, the Greek intellectuals persisted with their attempts at understanding and introduced a whole new philosophy, coining new terms and extending existent ones in order to syncretise the Egyptian and Greek bases.
<br><br>
Those newly formed Greek ideas and their later Latin counterparts are still present in modern western philosophy, and general knowledge, and will be explained when they are  encountered all through the present work at hand. For instance, the most important one, overall, would be the term Logos. For the Egyptians it represented that steady stream of thought mentioned earlier. For the Greeks it was a thing of substance (ousia) and meant divine light and discourse emanating from and being God.
<br>


<h5>Hermetism<br>
Who Knows Himself, Knows the All</h5>

The writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus over time came to be known under the umbrella term of Hermetism, or sometines Hermeticism, which developed many parallel disciplines. In modern scholarship, these writings are called Hermetica organised as two groups, philosophical and technical. The first group comprises texts based upon an Egyptian style of story telling from one who knows informing another who doesn't. They are regarded as religious texts about the Divine and the Creation of the Cosmos.
<br><br>
The technical Hermetica on the other hand can be safely considered as having taken a more practical approach to seeing and experimenting with the physical manifestations of the natural world, albeit entwined with the divine. The subjects covered included astrology, medicine, alchemy, magic, theurgy, spirituality, prediction and religious ritual. Since these run parallel to each other, studying one leads into greater insight into another.
<br><br>
Alchemy is notorious for using an obscure language and presentation but offers up further ways to understand and improve upon astrology, because both alchemy and astrology stem from the common hermetic root. Conversely knowing about astrology provides greater access to discover what is actually meant by alchemy, namely that it is about the practitioner, more than the mentioned substances and processes.
<br><br>
There are a lot of technical terms being used in the Hermetic arts and as already mentioned, the most fundamental would be that of the Logos which can mean in various contexts, speech, word, thought, light, time, boundlessness, formlessnes or coming together. There is a Divine Logos penetrating everything in the Cosmos, as well as a personal logos in every creature.
<br><br>
It is through the Divine Logos that humans can communicate. It is the channel which facilitates the creation of an idea, as well as a stream of that idea, and ultimately as it touches upon the personal logos of another person, the detection of the idea and possible understanding of it.
<br><br>
The Logos in unison with the naturally physiologically associated speech and hearing organs outwardly expresses those innerly perceived contacts to both the personal logos and under some circumstances, the Cosmic Logos. In this manner, the Logos embraces a much broader field of potential communication.
<br><br>
According to Hermetism, humans are unique in the Cosmos for they have been divinely created by the Nous and recreated through Nature making them partly immortal and partly mortal. The immortal part basically equates to the personal logos and is seated within the uppermost 8th and 9th cosmic worlds.
<br><br>
The natural and mortal part is bound to the lower seven planetary worlds or spheres and by which entanglement,  unconscious desires drive behaviour contrary to the logos/soul/spirit. As the effects increase, planetary daimonic forces take possession of the human, who without intervention becomes permanently bound to the material plane of Nature, completely unaware of reality. The Hermetic system provides means for overcoming this plight.

<h5>Hellenistic Astrology</h5>

The leading authors who talk of hermetic astrology in the ancient Hellenistic world of Alexandria were Claudius Ptolomy and Vettius Valens. This was a few centuries after the earliest Hermetica appeared but by this time the astrology of their day had developed so far that their writing is still consistent with modern astrology.
<br><br>
When the Alexandrian Empire was conquered by Islam in the eighth century, many treatises were translated into Arabic and Persian and contain a lot of hermetic astrology. These in turn made their way into Latin translations and stood as the fundament of early European thought.
<br><br>
Being associated with Islamic philosophy over many centuries modified the Hermetica into magical, mystical, predictive (mantical), alchemical and medical pursuits. It is in these forms that scholars came to know of the supernatural intermingled with the divine. It was also the instigator of concern over its highly superstitious nature.

<h2 class="subtitle">About</h2>
Hi, my name is Rod Schneider and I have created this website to illustrate how, with the help of astrology, that negativity can be converted into something more positive. The astrology being shown here is rooted in the most ancient inceptions derived from Hermetism. It is technical but in the hands of a practioner already familiar with astrology has great potential to be helpful. There is also much help for non-astrologers to use astrology in a different manner, namely with cycles and phases. <br><br>Comments and contributions are always welcome.<br><br>
